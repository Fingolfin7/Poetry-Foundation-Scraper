        "The New Church": "The old cupola glinted above the clouds, shone\n among fir trees, but it took him an hour\n\n for the half mile all the way up the hill. As he trailed,\n the village passed him by, greeted him,\n\n asked about his health, but everybody hurried\n to catch the mass, left him leaning against fences,\n\n measuring the road with the walking stick he sculpted.\n He yearned for the day when the new church\n\n would be built--right across the road. Now\n it rises above the moon: saints in frescoes\n\n meet the eye, and only the rain has started to cut\n through the shingles on the roof of his empty\n\n house. The apple trees have taken over the sky,\n sequestered the gate, sidled over the porch."

Stones in the fields\n say he was not a farmer; the still-sealed jars\n in the cellar say she left in a nervous haste.\n And the child?

Now children,\n stiffened by winter\n and dressed, somehow,\n like old men, mutter\n and bend to the work\n of building dams.\n But such a spring is brief;\n by five o'clock\n the chill of sundown,\n darkness, the blue TVs\n flashing like storms\n in the picture windows,\n the yards gone gray,\n the wet dogs barking\n at nothing. Far off\n across the cornfields\n staked for streets and sewers,\n the body of a farmer\n missing since fall\n will show up\n in his garden tomorrow,\n as unexpected\n as a tulip.",

A Sunday\n afternoon; July. Driving along\n with your hand out squeezing the air,\n a meadowlark waiting on every post.\n\n Behind a shelterbelt of cedars,\n top-deep in hollyhocks, pollen and bees,\n a pickup kicks its fenders off\n and settles back to read the clouds.\n\n You feel like that; you feel like letting\n your tires go flat, like letting the mice\n build a nest in your muffler, like being\n no more than a truck in the weeds,\n\n clucking with chickens or sticky with honey\n or holding a skinny old man in your lap\n while he watches the road, waiting\n for someone to wave to. You feel like\n\n waving. You feel like stopping the car\n and dancing around on the road. You wave\n instead and leave your hand out gliding\n larklike over the wheat, over the houses.",
        "In the Basement of the Goodwill Store": "In musty light, in the thin brown air\n of damp carpet, doll heads and rust,\n beneath long rows of sharp footfalls\n like nails in a lid, an old man stands\n trying on glasses, lifting each pair\n from the box like a glittering fish\n and holding it up to the light\n of a dirty bulb. Near him, a heap\n of enameled pans as white as skulls\n looms in the catacomb shadows,\n and old toilets with dry red throats\n cough up bouquets of curtain rods.\n\n You've seen him somewhere before.\n He's wearing the green leisure suit\n you threw out with the garbage,\n and the Christmas tie you hated,\n and the ventilated wingtip shoes\n you found in your father's closet\n and wore as a joke. And the glasses\n which finally fit him, through which\n he looks to see you looking back--\n two mirrors which flash and glance--\n are those through which one day\n you too will look down over the years,\n when you have grown old and thin\n and no longer particular,\n and the things you once thought\n you were rid of forever\n have taken you back in their arms.",
        "A Room in the Past": "It's a kitchen. Its curtains fill\n with a morning light so bright   \n you can't see beyond its windows   \n into the afternoon.

No one's at home   \n in this room. Its counter is wiped,   \n and the dishrag hangs from its nail,   \n a dry leaf. In housedresses of mist,   \n blue aprons of rain, my grandmother   \n moved through this life like a ghost,   \n and when she had finished her years,   \n she put them all back in their places\n and wiped out the sink, turning her back   \n on the rest of us, forever.",
        "A Letter in October": "Dawn comes later and later now,\n and I, who only a month ago\n could sit with coffee every morning\n watching the light walk down the hill\n to the edge of the pond and place\n a doe there, shyly drinking,\n\n then see the light step out upon\n the water, sowing reflections\n to either side--a garden\n of trees that grew as if by magic--\n now see no more than my face,\n mirrored by darkness, pale and odd,\n\n startled by time. While I slept,\n night in its thick winter jacket\n bridled the doe with a twist\n of wet leaves and led her away,\n then brought its black horse with harness\n that creaked like a cricket, and turned\n\n the water garden under. I woke,\n and at the waiting window found\n the curtains open to my open face;\n beyond me, darkness. And I,\n who only wished to keep looking out,\n must now keep looking in.",
        "Walking on Tiptoe": "Long ago we quit lifting our heels\n like the others--horse, dog, and tiger--\n though we thrill to their speed\n as they flee. Even the mouse\n bearing the great weight of a nugget\n of dog food is enviably graceful.\n There is little spring to our walk,\n we are so burdened with responsibility,\n all of the disciplinary actions\n that have fallen to us, the punishments,\n the killings, and all with our feet\n bound stiff in the skins of the conquered.\n But sometimes, in the early hours,\n we can feel what it must have been like\n to be one of them, up on our toes,\n stealing past doors where others are sleeping,\n and suddenly able to see in the dark."

If\n I could have cautioned the mother rabbit\n I would. If I could summon the\n Bunnies to fit him in beneath\n the belly's swell\n I would. But instead, I stood frozen, wishing\n for some equity. This must be\n why it's called Wild Life because of all the\n crazed emotions tangled up in\n the underbrush within us.\n Did I tell you how\n the smallest one, black and trembling,\n hopped behind the kudzu\n still filigreed with wanting?\n\n Should we talk now of animal heritage, their species,\n creature development?

        "The Hot Dog Factory (1937)": "Of course now children take it for granted but once\n we watched boxes on a conveyor belt, sliding by,\n magically filled and closed, packed and wrapped.\n We couldn't get enough of it, running alongside the machine.\n In kindergarten Miss Haynes walked our class down\n Stuyvesant Avenue, then up Prospect Street\n to the hot dog factory. Only the girls got to go\n as the boys were too wild.\n We stood in line, wiggling with excitement as the man\n talked about how they made hot dogs, then he handed us\n one, and Jan dropped hers, so I broke mine in half.\n This was the happiest day of our lives,\n children whose mothers didn't drive, and had nowhere\n to go but school and home, to be taken to that street\n to watch the glittering steel and shining rubber belts moving,\n moving meats, readymade.  I wish I could talk with Jan,\n recalling the miracle and thrill of the hot dog factory,\n when she was alive, before it all stopped--\n bright lights, glistening motors, spinning wheels.",

He studied to be a priest in Sicily but saved his sister Maggie from marrying a bad guy by coming to America. Uncle Joey is rolling dough and spooning sauce. Uncle Joey, is always scrubbed clean, sobered up, in a white starched shirt, after cops delivered him home just hours before. The waitresses are helping themselves to handfuls of cash out of the drawer, playing the numbers with Moon Mullin and Shad, sent in from Broad Street. 1942, tomato pies with cheese, 25 cents. With anchovies, large, 50 cents. A whole dinner is 60 cents (before 6 pm). How the soldiers, bussed in from Fort Dix, would stand outside all the way down Warren Street, waiting for this new taste treat, young guys in uniform, lined up and laughing, learning Italian, before being shipped out to fight the last great war."

        "Mysterious Neighbors": "Country people rise early as their distant lights testify. They don't hold water in common. Each house has a personal source, like a bank account, a stone vault. Some share eggs, some share expertise, and some won't even wave. A walk for the mail elevates the heart rate. Last November I saw a woman down the road walk out to her mailbox dressed in blaze orange cap to boot, a cautious soul. Bullets can't read her No Trespassing sign. Strange to think they're in the air like lead bees with a fatal sting. Our neighbor across the road sits in his kitchen with his rifle handy and the window open. You never know when. Once he shot a trophy with his barrel resting on the sill. He's in his seventies, born here, joined the Navy, came back. Hard work never hurt a man until suddenly he was another broken tool.

We who were this planet and yearned for touch.\n Every planted thought grew plant\n Ladders to the stars, way back, before there was\n No way back, Miss Mary Mack.\n We used to sing along the buttons of her\n Dress. Our babies are always\n Our babies. Even back then when time waved through\n The corn. We knew our plants like\n Relatives. Their stories were our stories, there\n Were songs for everything -- I\n Should say \"are\" songs for every transformation\n They link between way back and\n Now, the forever now, a time when a young\n Mvskoke man and woman\n Walked through the shimmer of the early evening.\n They had become as one song.\n They lay down when it was dark. I can hear their\n Intimate low-voice talking.\n How they tease one another with such gut love.\n Earth makes a bed, with pillow\n Mounds. And it is there as the night insects sing\n They conceived their first child. They\n Will look back as they walk East toward the sunrise.\n The raw stalks of beginning\n Will drink the light, root deeply dark into earth.\n In the tracks of their loving\n The plant-child emerges, first the seed head, then\n Leafy, long male body and the white female\n Flowers of tobacco, or\nHece, as the people called it when it called\n To them. Come here. We were brought\n To you from those who love you. We will help you.\n And that's how it began, way\n Back, when we knew how to hear the songs of plants\n And could sing back, like now\n On paper, with marks like bird feet, but where are\n Our ears? They have grown to fit\n Around earbuds, to hear music made for cold\n Cash, like our beloved smoke-\n Making threaded with addiction and dead words.\n Sing this song back to me, girl.\n In the moonlight, tobacco plant had silver\n Moon buttons all up her back.\n We're getting dressed to go plant new songs with words.\n Our sun is dimming faster.\n Mvto hece, mvto hvse, mvto e -- \n Kanvchaga, mvto ah",

        "Everybody Has a Heartache: A Blues": "In the United terminal in Chicago at five on a Friday afternoonThe sky is breaking with rain and wind and all the flightsAre delayed forever. We will never get to where we are goingAnd there's no way back to where we've been.The sun and the moon have disappeared to an island far from \nanywhere.Everybody has a heartache -- The immense gatekeeper of Gate Z-100 keeps his cool.This guardian of the sky teases me and makes me smile through the mess,Building up his airline by stacking it against the company I usually travel:Come on over to our side, we'll treat you nice.I laugh as he hands me back my ticket, then he turns to charmThe next customer, his feet tired in his minimum wage shoes.Everybody has a heartache -- The man with his head bobbing to music no one else can hear has that satisfiedFeel -- a full belly of sweet and a wife who sings heartache to sleep.In his luggage (that will be lost and never found) is a musty dream of flyingSolo to Africa, with a stop on the return to let go the stories too difficult toCarry home. He'll take off his shoes to walk in a warm, tropical sea.He'll sing to the ancestors:Take me home to mama. No one cooks like her.But all the mamas worked to the bone gone too young. Broken by The Man.Everybody has a heartache --  Everyone's mouthing fried, sweet, soft and fat,While we wait for word in the heart of the scrambled beast.The sparkle of soda wets the dream core.That woman over there the color of broth did what she was told.It's worked out well as can be expected in a worldWhere she was no beauty queen and was never seen,Always in the back of someplace in the back -- She holds the newest baby. He has croup.Shush, shush. Go to sleep, my little baby sheepie.He sits up front of her with his new crop of teeth.Everybody has a heartache -- This man speaks to no one, but his body does.Half his liver is swollen with anger; the other half is tryingTo apologize -- What a mess I've made of history, he thinks without thinking.Mother coming through the screen door, her clothes torn,Whimpering: It's okay baby, please don't cry.Don't cry. Baby don't cry.And he never cries again. Everybody has a heartache --  Baby girl dressed to impress, toddles about with lace on this and ruffle on that -- Her mother's relatives are a few hundred miles away poised to \nwelcome.They might as well live on a planet of ice cream.She's a brand new wing, grown up from a family's broken hope.Dance girl, you carry our joy.Just don't look down. Everybody has a heartache -- Good-looking punk girl taps this on her screento a stranger she has never seen:Just before dawn, you're high again beneath a marbled sky,I was slick fine leather with a drink in my hand.Flying with a comet messenger nobody sees.The quick visitor predicts that the top will be the bottomAnd the bottom will flatten and dive into the sea.I want to tell her:You will dine with the lobster king, andYou will dance with crabs clicking castanets. You will sleep-Walk beyond the vestibule of sadness with a strangerYou have loved for years.Everybody has a heartache -- This silence in the noise of the terminal is a mountain of bison skulls.Nobody knows, nobody sees -- Unless the indigenous are dancing powwow all decked out in flash and beautyWe just don't exist. We've been dispersed to an outlaw cowboy tale.What were they thinking with all those guns and those handcuffsIn a size for babies?They just don't choose to remember.We're here.In the terminal of stopped time I went unsteady to the beat,Driven by a hungry spirit who is drunk with words and songs.What can I do?I have to take care of it.The famished spirit eats fire, poetry, and rain; it only wants love.I argue:You want love?Do you even know what it looks like, smells like?But you cannot argue with hungry spirits.I don't know exactly where I'm going; I only know where I've been,I want to tell the man who sifted through the wreck to find us hereIn the blues shack of disappeared history -- I feel the weight of his heart against my cheek.His hand is on my back pulling me to him in the dark, to a placeNo soldiers can reach.I hear the whoop-cries of warriors calling fire for a stand Against the brutality of forgetfulness -- Everybody has a heartache -- We will all find our way, no matter fire leaping through holes in jump time,No matter earthquake, or the breaking of love spilling over the dreck of matterIn the ether, stacking one burdenAgainst the other -- We have a heartache.",
        "An American Sunrise": "We were running out of breath, as we ran out to meet ourselves. We\n were surfacing the edge of our ancestors' fights, and ready to strike.\n It was difficult to lose days in the Indian bar if you were straight.\n Easy if you played pool and drank to remember to forget. We\n made plans to be professional -- and did. And some of us could sing\n so we drummed a fire-lit pathway up to those starry stars. Sin\n was invented by the Christians, as was the Devil, we sang. We\n were the heathens, but needed to be saved from them -- thin\n chance. We knew we were all related in this story, a little gin\n will clarify the dark and make us all feel like dancing. We\n had something to do with the origins of blues and jazz\n I argued with a Pueblo as I filled the jukebox with dimes in June,\n forty years later and we still want justice. We are still America. We\n know the rumors of our demise. We spit them out. They die\n soon.",

Circled in blue sky\n In wind, swept our hearts clean\n With sacred wings.\n We see you, see ourselves and know\n That we must take the utmost care\n And kindness in all things.\n Breathe in, knowing we are made of\n All this, and breathe, knowing\n We are truly blessed because we\n Were born, and die soon within a\n True circle of motion,\n Like eagle rounding out the morning\n Inside us.\n We pray that it will be done\n In beauty.\n In beauty.",
        "Insomnia and the Seven Steps to Grace": "At dawn the panther of the heavens peers over the edge of the world.   \n She hears the stars gossip with the sun, sees the moon washing her lean   \n darkness with water electrified by prayers. All over the world there are those   \n who can't sleep, those who never awaken.   \n\n My granddaughter sleeps on the breast of her mother with milk on   \n her mouth. A fly contemplates the sweetness of lactose.\n\n Her father is wrapped in the blanket of nightmares. For safety he   \n approaches the red hills near Thoreau. They recognize him and sing for   \n him.   \n\n Her mother has business in the house of chaos. She is a prophet dis-   \n guised as a young mother who is looking for a job. She appears at the   \n door of my dreams and we put the house back together.   \n\n Panther watches as human and animal souls are lifted to the heavens by   \n rain clouds to partake of songs of beautiful thunder.   \n\n Others are led by deer and antelope in the wistful hours to the vil-   \n lages of their ancestors. There they eat cornmeal cooked with berries   \n that stain their lips with purple while the tree of life flickers in the sun.   \n\n It's October, though the season before dawn is always winter. On the   \n city streets of this desert town lit by chemical yellow travelers   \n search for home.   \n\n Some have been drinking and intimate with strangers. Others are   \n escapees from the night shift, sip lukewarm coffee, shift gears to the   \n other side of darkness.   \n\n One woman stops at a red light, turns over a worn tape to the last   \n chorus of a whispery blues. She has decided to live another day.   \n\n The stars take notice, as do the half-asleep flowers, prickly pear and   \n chinaberry tree who drink exhaust into their roots, into the earth.   \n\n She guns the light to home where her children are asleep and may   \n never know she ever left. That their fate took a turn in the land of   \n nightmares toward the sun may be untouchable knowledge.   \n\n It is a sweet sound.   \n\n The panther relative yawns and puts her head between her paws.   \n She dreams of the house of panthers and the seven steps to grace.",
        "Perhaps the World Ends Here": "The world begins at a kitchen table. No matter what, we must eat to live.\n\n The gifts of earth are brought and prepared, set on the table. So it has been since creation, and it will go on.\n\n We chase chickens or dogs away from it. Babies teethe at the corners. They scrape their knees under it.\n\n It is here that children are given instructions on what it means to be human. We make men at it, we make women.\n\n At this table we gossip, recall enemies and the ghosts of lovers.\n\n Our dreams drink coffee with us as they put their arms around our children. They laugh with us at our poor falling-down selves and as we put ourselves back together once again at the table.\n\n This table has been a house in the rain, an umbrella in the sun.\n\n Wars have begun and ended at this table. It is a place to hide in the shadow of terror. A place to celebrate the terrible victory.\n\n We have given birth on this table, and have prepared our parents for burial here.\n\n At this table we sing with joy, with sorrow. We pray of suffering and remorse. We give thanks.\n\n Perhaps the world will end at the kitchen table, while we are laughing and crying, eating of the last sweet bite.",
        "My House is the Red Earth": "My house is the red earth; it could be the center of the world. I've heard New York, Paris, or Tokyo called the center of the world, but I say it is magnificently humble. You could drive by and miss it. Radio waves can obscure it. Words cannot construct it, for there are some sounds left to sacred wordless form. For instance, that fool crow, picking through trash near the corral, understands the center of the world as greasy strips of fat. Just ask him. He doesn't have to say that the earth has turned scarlet through fierce belief, after centuries of heartbreak and laughter--he perches on the blue bowl of the sky, and laughs."

These were moments, years,   \n Solid with reality, faces, namable events, kisses, heroic acts,   \n But like the friendly beginning of a geometrical progression\n Not too reassuring, as though meaning could be cast aside some day   \n When it had been outgrown. Better, you said, to stay cowering   \n Like this in the early lessons, since the promise of learning   \n Is a delusion, and I agreed, adding that\n Tomorrow would alter the sense of what had already been learned,   \n That the learning process is extended in this way, so that from this standpoint\n None of us ever graduates from college,\n For time is an emulsion, and probably thinking not to grow up   \n Is the brightest kind of maturity for us, right now at any rate.\n And you see, both of us were right, though nothing\n Has somehow come to nothing; the avatars\n Of our conforming to the rules and living\n Around the home have made--well, in a sense, \"good citizens\" of us,   \n Brushing the teeth and all that, and learning to accept\n The charity of the hard moments as they are doled out,\n For this is action, this not being sure, this careless\n Preparing, sowing the seeds crooked in the furrow,\n Making ready to forget, and always coming back\n To the mooring of starting out, that day so long ago.",
        "The Instruction Manual": "As I sit looking out of a window of the building\n I wish I did not have to write the instruction manual on the uses of a new metal.\n I look down into the street and see people, each walking with an inner peace,   \n And envy them--they are so far away from me!\n Not one of them has to worry about getting out this manual on schedule.   \n And, as my way is, I begin to dream, resting my elbows on the desk and leaning out of the window a little,\n Of dim Guadalajara! City of rose-colored flowers!\n City I wanted most to see, and most did not see, in Mexico!\n But I fancy I see, under the press of having to write the instruction manual,   \n Your public square, city, with its elaborate little bandstand!\n The band is playing Scheherazade by Rimsky-Korsakov.\n Around stand the flower girls, handing out rose- and lemon-colored flowers,   \n Each attractive in her rose-and-blue striped dress (Oh! such shades of rose and blue),\n And nearby is the little white booth where women in green serve you green and yellow fruit.\n The couples are parading; everyone is in a holiday mood.\n First, leading the parade, is a dapper fellow\n Clothed in deep blue. On his head sits a white hat\n And he wears a mustache, which has been trimmed for the occasion.\n His dear one, his wife, is young and pretty; her shawl is rose, pink, and white.   \n Her slippers are patent leather, in the American fashion,\n And she carries a fan, for she is modest, and does not want the crowd to see her face too often.\n But everybody is so busy with his wife or loved one\n I doubt they would notice the mustachioed man's wife.\n Here come the boys! They are skipping and throwing little things on the sidewalk\n Which is made of gray tile. One of them, a little older, has a toothpick in his teeth.\n He is silenter than the rest, and affects not to notice the pretty young girls in white.\n But his friends notice them, and shout their jeers at the laughing girls.   \n Yet soon all this will cease, with the deepening of their years,\n And love bring each to the parade grounds for another reason.\n But I have lost sight of the young fellow with the toothpick.\n Wait--there he is--on the other side of the bandstand,\n Secluded from his friends, in earnest talk with a young girl\n Of fourteen or fifteen. I try to hear what they are saying\n But it seems they are just mumbling something--shy words of love, probably.\n She is slightly taller than he, and looks quietly down into his sincere eyes.   \n She is wearing white. The breeze ruffles her long fine black hair against her olive cheek.\n Obviously she is in love. The boy, the young boy with the toothpick, he is in love too;\n His eyes show it. Turning from this couple,\n I see there is an intermission in the concert.\n The paraders are resting and sipping drinks through straws\n (The drinks are dispensed from a large glass crock by a lady in dark blue),   \n And the musicians mingle among them, in their creamy white uniforms, and talk\n About the weather, perhaps, or how their kids are doing at school.\n\n Let us take this opportunity to tiptoe into one of the side streets.   \n Here you may see one of those white houses with green trim   \n That are so popular here. Look--I told you!\n It is cool and dim inside, but the patio is sunny.\n An old woman in gray sits there, fanning herself with a palm leaf fan.   \n She welcomes us to her patio, and offers us a cooling drink.   \n \"My son is in Mexico City,\" she says. \"He would welcome you too   \n If he were here. But his job is with a bank there.\n Look, here is a photograph of him.\"\n And a dark-skinned lad with pearly teeth grins out at us from the worn leather frame.\n We thank her for her hospitality, for it is getting late\n And we must catch a view of the city, before we leave, from a good high place.\n That church tower will do--the faded pink one, there against the fierce blue of the sky. Slowly we enter.\n The caretaker, an old man dressed in brown and gray, asks us how long we have been in the city, and how we like it here.\n His daughter is scrubbing the steps--she nods to us as we pass into the tower.\n Soon we have reached the top, and the whole network of the city extends before us.\n There is the rich quarter, with its houses of pink and white, and its crumbling, leafy terraces.\n There is the poorer quarter, its homes a deep blue.\n There is the market, where men are selling hats and swatting flies\n And there is the public library, painted several shades of pale green and beige.\n Look! There is the square we just came from, with the promenaders.   \n There are fewer of them, now that the heat of the day has increased,   \n But the young boy and girl still lurk in the shadows of the bandstand.   \n And there is the home of the little old lady--\n She is still sitting in the patio, fanning herself.\n How limited, but how complete withal, has been our experience of Guadalajara!\n We have seen young love, married love, and the love of an aged mother for her son.\n We have heard the music, tasted the drinks, and looked at colored houses.   \n What more is there to do, except stay? And that we cannot do.\n And as a last breeze freshens the top of the weathered old tower, I turn my\n gaze\n Back to the instruction manual which has made me dream of Guadalajara.",

        "If You Said You Would Come With Me": "In town it was very urban but in the country cows were covering the hills. The clouds were near and very moist. I was walking along the pavement with Anna, enjoying the scattered scenery. Suddenly a sound like a deep bell came from behind us. We both turned to look. \"It's the words you spoke in the past, coming back to haunt you,\" Anna explained. \"They always do, you know.\"\n       Indeed I did. Many times this deep bell-like tone had intruded itself on my thoughts, scrambling them at first, then rearranging them in apple-pie order. \"Two crows,\" the voice seemed to say, \"were sitting on a sundial in the God-given sunlight. Then one flew away.\"\n      \"Yes . . . and then?\" I wanted to ask, but I kept silent. We turned into a courtyard and walked up several flights of stairs to the roof, where a party was in progress. \"This is my friend Hans,\" Anna said by way of introduction. No one paid much attention and several guests moved away to the balustrade to admire the view of orchards and vineyards, approaching their autumn glory. One of the women however came to greet us in a friendly manner. I was wondering if this was a \"harvest home,\" a phrase I had often heard but never understood.\n      \"Welcome to my home . . . well, to our home,\" the woman said gaily. \"As you can see, the grapes are being harvested.\" It seemed she could read my mind. \"They say this year's vintage will be a mediocre one, but the sight is lovely, nonetheless. Don't you agree, Mr. . . .\"\n      \"Hans,\" I replied curtly. The prospect was indeed a lovely one, but I wanted to leave. Making some excuse I guided Anna by the elbow toward the stairs and we left.\n      \"That wasn't polite of you,\" she said dryly.\n      \"Honey, I've had enough of people who can read your mind. When I want it done I'll go to a mind reader.\"\n      \"I happen to be one and I can tell you what you're thinking is false. Listen to what the big bell says: 'We are all strangers on our own turf, in our own time.' You should have paid attention. Now adjustments will have to be made.\"",

        "Syringa": "Orpheus liked the glad personal quality\n Of the things beneath the sky. Of course, Eurydice was a part   \n Of this. Then one day, everything changed. He rends   \n Rocks into fissures with lament. Gullies, hummocks   \n Can't withstand it. The sky shudders from one horizon   \n To the other, almost ready to give up wholeness.   \n Then Apollo quietly told him: \"Leave it all on earth.   \n Your lute, what point? Why pick at a dull pavan few care to   \n Follow, except a few birds of dusty feather,\n Not vivid performances of the past.\" But why not?   \n All other things must change too.\n The seasons are no longer what they once were,   \n But it is the nature of things to be seen only once,\n As they happen along, bumping into other things, getting along   \n Somehow. That's where Orpheus made his mistake.   \n Of course Eurydice vanished into the shade;\n She would have even if he hadn't turned around.\n No use standing there like a gray stone toga as the whole wheel   \n Of recorded history flashes past, struck dumb, unable to utter an intelligent\n Comment on the most thought-provoking element in its train.   \n Only love stays on the brain, and something these people,   \n These other ones, call life. Singing accurately\n So that the notes mount straight up out of the well of   \n Dim noon and rival the tiny, sparkling yellow flowers   \n Growing around the brink of the quarry, encapsulates   \n The different weights of the things.\n                                                        But it isn't enough   \n To just go on singing. Orpheus realized this\n And didn't mind so much about his reward being in heaven   \n After the Bacchantes had torn him apart, driven   \n Half out of their minds by his music, what it was doing to them.\n Some say it was for his treatment of Eurydice.\n But probably the music had more to do with it, and   \n The way music passes, emblematic\n Of life and how you cannot isolate a note of it\n And say it is good or bad. You must\n Wait till it's over. \"The end crowns all,\"\n Meaning also that the \"tableau\"\n Is wrong. For although memories, of a season, for example,   \n Melt into a single snapshot, one cannot guard, treasure   \n That stalled moment. It too is flowing, fleeting;   \n It is a picture of flowing, scenery, though living, mortal,   \n Over which an abstract action is laid out in blunt,   \n Harsh strokes. And to ask more than this\n Is to become the tossing reeds of that slow,\n Powerful stream, the trailing grasses\n Playfully tugged at, but to participate in the action   \n No more than this. Then in the lowering gentian sky   \n Electric twitches are faintly apparent first, then burst forth   \n Into a shower of fixed, cream-colored flares. The horses   \n Have each seen a share of the truth, though each thinks,   \n \"I'm a maverick. Nothing of this is happening to me,   \n Though I can understand the language of birds, and   \n The itinerary of the lights caught in the storm is fully apparent to me.\n Their jousting ends in music much\n As trees move more easily in the wind after a summer storm   \n And is happening in lacy shadows of shore-trees, now, day after day.\"\n\n But how late to be regretting all this, even\n Bearing in mind that regrets are always late, too late!   \n To which Orpheus, a bluish cloud with white contours,   \n Replies that these are of course not regrets at all,   \n Merely a careful, scholarly setting down of\n Unquestioned facts, a record of pebbles along the way.\n And no matter how all this disappeared,   \n Or got where it was going, it is no longer   \n Material for a poem. Its subject\n Matters too much, and not enough, standing there helplessly   \n While the poem streaked by, its tail afire, a bad   \n Comet screaming hate and disaster, but so turned inward   \n That the meaning, good or other, can never   \n Become known. The singer thinks\n Constructively, builds up his chant in progressive stages   \n Like a skyscraper, but at the last minute turns away.   \n The song is engulfed in an instant in blackness   \n Which must in turn flood the whole continent   \n With blackness, for it cannot see. The singer   \n Must then pass out of sight, not even relieved   \n Of the evil burthen of the words. Stellification   \n Is for the few, and comes about much later   \n When all record of these people and their lives   \n Has disappeared into libraries, onto microfilm.   \n A few are still interested in them. \"But what about   \n So-and-so?\" is still asked on occasion. But they lie   \n Frozen and out of touch until an arbitrary chorus\n Speaks of a totally different incident with a similar name   \n In whose tale are hidden syllables\n\n\n Of what happened so long before that\n In some small town, one indifferent summer.",

        "Leave the Hand In": "Furthermore, Mr. Tuttle used to have to run in the streets.   Now, each time friendship happens, they're fully booked.   Sporting with amaryllis in the shade is all fine and good,   but when your sparring partner gets there first   you wonder if it was all worth it. \"Yes, why do it?\"   I'm on hold. It will take quite a lot for this music   to grow on me. I meant no harm. I've helped him   from getting stuck before. Dumb thing. All my appetites are friendly.   Children too are free to go and come as they please.   I ask you only to choose between us, then shut down this election.   But don't reveal too much of your hand at any given time.   Then up and pipes the major, leave the hand in,   or change the vows. The bold, enduring menace of courtship is upon us   like the plague, and none of us can say what trouble   will be precipitated once it has had its way with us.   Our home is marshland.

        "Boundary Issues": "Here in life, they would understand.   How could it be otherwise? We had groped too,   unwise, till the margin began to give way,   at which point all was sullen, or lost, or both.    Now it was time, and there was nothing for it.    We had a good meal, I and my friend,   slurping from the milk pail, grabbing at newer vegetables.   Yet life was a desert. Come home, in good faith.   You can still decide to. But it wanted warmth.   Otherwise ruse and subtlety would become impossible   in the few years or hours left to us. \"Yes, but . . .\"   The iconic beggars shuffled off   too. I told you,   once a breach emerges it will become a chasm   before anyone's had a chance to waver. A dispute   on the far side of town erupts into a war   in no time at all, and ends as abruptly. The tendency to heal   sweeps all before it, into the arroyo, the mine shaft,   into whatever pocket you were contemplating. And the truly lost   make up for it. It's always us that has to pay.    I have a suggestion to make: draw the sting out   as probingly as you please. Plaster the windows over   with wood pulp against the noon gloom proposing its enigmas,   its elixirs. Banish truth-telling. That's the whole point, as I understand it.   Each new investigation rebuilds the urgency,   like a sand rampart. And further reflection undermines it,   causing its eventual collapse. We could see all that   from a distance, as on a curving abacus, in urgency mode   from day one, but by then dispatches hardly mattered.   It was camaraderie, or something like it, that did,   poring over us like we were papyri, hoping to find one   correct attitude sketched on the gaslit air, night's friendly takeover.",
        "Late Echo": "Alone with our madness and favorite flower\n We see that there really is nothing left to write about.\n Or rather, it is necessary to write about the same old things\n In the same way, repeating the same things over and over\n For love to continue and be gradually different.\n\n Beehives and ants have to be re-examined eternally\n And the color of the day put in\n Hundreds of times and varied from summer to winter\n For it to get slowed down to the pace of an authentic\n Saraband and huddle there, alive and resting.\n\n Only then can the chronic inattention\n Of our lives drape itself around us, conciliatory\n And with one eye on those long tan plush shadows\n That speak so deeply into our unprepared knowledge\n Of ourselves, the talking engines of our day."

Beauty occurs on the surface of plants; the sun darkens the skin of my child, he is so small, he is beautiful (I can see; it is obvious) and everything about him is beautiful. Because he is small the bite of some insect, its venom makes his hand swell. He appears to feel nothing. He smashes his skull against the floor. He screams. I hold him in my lap on the kitchen floor in front of an open freezer, pressing a pack of frozen clay against his forehead. He likes the cold. I see; it is so obvious. Hydrangea. When I move, when I walk pushing my child's stroller (it is both walking and pushing or hauling, sometimes, also, lifting; it is having another body, an adjunct body composed of errand and weight and tenderness and no small amount of power), I imagine I can feel this small amount of weight, this 5 pounds like 20, interfering with the twitch of every muscle in my body. As an object, a mother is confusing, a middle-aged mother with little spare flesh, I feel every inch of major muscle pulling against gravity and against the weight of my child, now sleeping. This is the hour for thinking hydrangea. Let no man look at me. I stop to brush the drowsy child's little eye. His face. He barely considers his mother. I am all around him.

Can you do that, Leon?\" \"Why,\n sure, Mr. President, you've got it. Normal, that's\n how I'm going to act. I won't let on, even if I'm\n tortured,\" I said, immediately regretting that \"tortured\"\n bit. He thanked me several times and hung up. I was\n dying to tell someone that the President himself called\n me, but I knew I couldn't. The sudden pressure to\n act normal was killing me. And what was going on\n anyway. I didn't know anything was going on. I\n saw the President on TV yesterday. He was shaking\n hands with a farmer. What if it wasn't really a\n farmer? I needed to buy some milk, but suddenly\n I was afraid to go out. I checked what I had on.\n I looked \"normal\" to me, but maybe I looked more\n like I was trying to be normal. That's pretty\n suspicious. I opened the door and looked around.\n What was going on? There was a car parked in front\n of my car that I had never seen before, a car that\n was trying to look normal, but I wasn't fooled.\n If you need milk, you have to get milk, otherwise\n people will think something's going on. I got into\n my car and sped down the road. I could feel those\n little radar guns popping behind every tree and bush,\n but, apparently, they were under orders not to stop\n me. I ran into Kirsten in the store. \"Hey, what's\n going on, Leon?\" she said. She had a very nice smile.\n I hated to lie to her. \"Nothing's going on. Just\n getting milk for my cat,\" I said. \"I didn't know\n you had a cat,\" she said. \"I meant to say coffee.\n You're right, I don't have a cat. Sometimes I\n refer to my coffee as my cat. It's just a private\n joke. Sorry,\" I said. \"Are you all right?\" she\n asked. \"Nothing's going on, Kirsten. I promise\n you. Everything is normal. The President shook\n hands with a farmer, a real farmer.

        "The Government Lake": "The way to the toy store was blocked by a fallen tree\n in the road. There was a policeman directing traffic down a\n side street. I asked him, \"What happened?\" He said, \"Lightning\n in the night.\" I took the turn and drove down the street\n looking for a way to turn back. Other streets were blocked by\n fallen trees, and I couldn't find a way back to the toy store.\n I kept driving and soon I was on the outskirts of town. I\n got on a highway and drove, soon forgetting the toy store and\n what I was supposed to get there. I drove on as if I was hypno-\n tized, not noticing the signs for turnoffs. I must have driven\n a couple of hours before I woke up, then I took the next exit\n and had no idea where I was. I drove down a straight tree-lined\n lane with farm houses on either side. There was a lake at the\n end of the lane. I pulled over and parked. I got out and\n started walking. There were several docks along the shore.\n I walked out on one and watched the ducks swimming and diving.\n There was something bobbing in the middle of the lake. I stared\n at it for a long time before I realized it was a man's head.\n Then, a moment later, it was a coconut. No, it was an old tire\n floating right side up. I gave up and started following the\n ducks. They would suddenly fly up and circle the lake and\n come down and splash land again. It was quite entertaining.\n A man walked up behind me and said, \"This government lake is\n off-limits to the public. You'll have to leave.\" I said,\n \"I didn't know it was a government lake. Why should it be\n off-limits?\" He said, \"I'm sorry. You'll have to leave.\"\n \"I don't even know where I am,\" I said. \"You'll still have\n to leave,\" he said. \"What about that man out there?\" I said,\n pointing to the tire. \"He's dead,\" he said. \"No, he's not.\n I just saw him move his arm,\" I said. He removed his pistol from\n his holster and fired a shot. \"Now he's dead,\" he said.",
        "The Truth": "Mitzy fell asleep as soon as we got home, but I didn't.\n The evening had upset me. Why did Jack keep asking me if I'd\n been married before? And why did my answer not satisfy him?\n It was probably just a bad joke. Jack's humor is off sometimes.\n But he's not a bad guy. Well, then I went to bed. When we woke up\n in the morning Mitzy said, \"Jack was right about you, wasn't he?\"\n \"What do you mean?\" I said. \"Jack said you were kicked out of\n the Army,\" she said. \"I was never in the Army, how could I be\n kicked out?\" I said. \"I don't think he likes me.\" \"Oh, I think\n Jack likes you a lot. He just wishes you were more interesting,\"\n she said. \"And by making me secretly divorced and secretly kicked\n out of the Army I'm instantly more interesting, is that it?\" I\n said. \"According to Jack you are,\" she said. \"I think we had better\n have breakfast,\" I said. \"Good idea,\" she said. During breakfast\n I said, \"Don't you think I'm interesting?\" \"Of course I do, honey,\"\n she said. \"Let's forget it. I mean, Jack is an old friend. Maybe\n he was just drunk,\" I said. \"That's probably it,\" she said.\n \"What are you going to do today?\" I asked. \"I'm thinking of buying\n a new dress for the wedding,\" she said. \"What wedding?\" I said.\n \"You know, Carol and Bob's wedding, next Saturday,\" she said.\n \"Oh God, I forgot all about it,\" I said. \"How could you forget?\n Bob's your best friend,\" she said. \"I know, I just had my mind\n on other things, but now I'll focus on their wedding, I promise,\"\n I said. Shortly after that Mitzy left the house. I cleaned up\n the breakfast dishes, then sat down on the couch. Why had Jack told\n the two secrets I had told him years ago. I had sworn him to\n silence, and now everybody knew. I had told him I would kill\n him if he ever told anybody. I wasn't going to kill him, but I\n did think about disappearing, just vanishing altogether. Where\n would I go? What would I do? And I do love Mitzy. I could tell\n her the truth.

        "The Thief": "My wife and I were spending a quiet night at home. She was reading\n a magazine on the couch and I was reading my novel in my chair. I said,\n \"Darling, can I fix you a cup of hot chocolate?\" She said, \"That would\n be great.\" So I got up and went into the kitchen and started to boil the\n milk. A few minutes later I handed her the cup. \"Hmmm, smells great.\n Thank you, darling,\" she said. I sat down and resumed my reading. She\n said, \"Did you know a tiger has the same number of bones in it as a monkey?\"\n \"I don't believe it,\" I said. \"And a whale has the same number as a mouse.\"\n \"Get out of here,\" I said. \"These are some little known facts discovered\n by a man named John D. Baxter,\" she said. \"He must be crazy,\" I said.\n Then we were quiet for a while. I looked over and she was asleep. I went\n on reading my novel. Then I put my novel down and got up and started to\n tiptoe around the house. I went into our bedroom and over to the dresser.\n I opened up Mitzy's jewelry box and let the jewels run through my fingers.\n There were some fantastic pieces in there, diamonds, rubies, emeralds. I\n thought about stealing some, but felt creepy about it. I put them back in\n the box and tiptoed back into the living room. I tripped on the coffee table\n and went crashing down. Mitzy woke with a start. \"Go back to sleep,\"\n I said. \"What was that?\" she said. \"I tripped, that's all,\" I said.\n She started to get up. \"Where are you going?\" I said. \"I want to look in\n my jewelry box,\" she said. \"Why?\" I said. \"I dreamed somebody was trying\n to steal something in there,\" she said. She went into the bedroom and\n looked in the box, then came out. \"It's okay,\" she said. \"Well, I'm glad,\"\n I said. She got back on the couch and picked up her magazine. \"Did you\n know jellyfish have bigger brains than humans?\" she said. \"I don't believe\n it,\" I said. \"Well, they do.

        "The Walk Home": "I told the doctor I wouldn't be seeing him again. \"No, I guess\n you won't,\" he said. I walked out the door feeling really good. Of\n course I knew I was going to die, but still the day looked bright to\n me. I walked down to the water. Ducks were circling around and about.\n A sailboat sailed by. I walked along the shore. The sun beat down\n on me. I felt as though I might live forever. I sat down on a bench\n and watched the joggers pass. A pretty blonde walked by and I said,\n \"Hello.\" She looked at me and said hello. A man with a greyhound\n on a leash walked by. I got up and started to walk. A woodpecker\n was pounding on a tree. An airplane flew over, leaving a thick trail of\n smoke. I left the lake and walked on up the road. I crossed at the\n streetlights and crossed the bridge. A car swerved to miss me. I\n thought, that could have been it, the end right there, but I walked on,\n bravely dodging the cars. When I got to the residential district, I\n felt relieved. There were large elms and maples overhanging the street,\n and people pushing baby carriages. Dogs ran loose everywhere. A man\n stopped me and asked if I knew where 347 Walnut Street was. I said\n I didn't. He said, \"Oh well, it didn't matter anyway.\" I said, \"Why?\"\n He said it was a funeral notice. I walked on, bumping into a fat lady\n with a load of groceries. I said I was sorry. She kept going, dropping\n a load of grapefruit. Then, further on, there was a giant explosion across\n the street. Police and firemen were there right away. It appears it\n was a gas main beneath the shop. No one was there, luckily, but the\n firetrucks had their hands full. I left before it was out. The shop\n was pretty much destroyed. When I got home I was tired. I made\n myself a cup of tea and sat down on the couch. I thought about calling\n my mother, but she was in heaven. I called her anyway. \"Mom, how are\n you doing?\" I said. \"I'm bored. Don't come here. There's nothing to\n do,\" she said. \"Aren't there angels?\" I said. \"Yes, but they're boring,\"\n she said. \"But I was going to come see you,\" I said. \"Go to hell, it's\n more exciting,\" she said. I had fallen asleep with my teacup in my\n hand. When I awoke I realized I had thought it was a phone. My\n mother would never be so sarcastic about heaven.",

        "Poem to Some of My Recent Poems": "My beloved little billiard balls,\n my polite mongrels, edible patriotic plums,\n you owe your beauty to your mother, who\n resembled a cyclindrical corned beef\n with all the trimmings, may God rest\n her forsaken soul, for it is all of us\n she forsook; and I shall never forget\n her sputtering embers, and then the little mound.\n Yes, my little rum runners, she had defective\n tear ducts and could weep only iced tea.\n She had petticoats beneath her eyelids.\n And in her last years she found ball bearings\n in her beehive puddings, she swore allegiance\n to Abyssinia. What should I have done?\n I played the piano and scrambled eggs.\n I had to navigate carefully around her brain's\n avalanche lest even a decent finale be forfeited.\n And her beauty still evermore.

The bride slept\n\n through much of it, and never did we figure out\n who was on whose team. I think the groom\n meant it in the end when he said, \"We never\n\n thought anyone would come.\" We were not the first\n to arrive, nor the last to leave. Who knows,\n it may all turn out for the best. And who\n\n really cares about such special days, they\n are not what we live for.",

Where do the viscera ever go?\n I am in a car driving to the northernmost point\n on this spit. Porte de Mort. Death's Northern Door.\n Literally where my grandmother lives. Her 89-year-old cousin\n has just fallen out a window but is all right, the bruises\n  \n like stained glass. Enthusiasm. To be in God.\n My grandmother says it is proof, and I nod my head\n because I too would like to live in such a world\n where an eighty-nine year old crawls out a window\n and falls seven feet to the ground, in turn the miracle\n of her body stained a deep blue, vitreous.

Who left that place in flames, the rubble\n of infinite hearths? The deer's eyes like perfect cataracts,\n the evidence cooling. When I think of my room in the earth,\n I can't breathe. A friend of a friend recently hit a small bear\n  \n with his car. At the end of my favorite novel a bear\n is dancing on a makeshift stage, the bear a grotesquerie\n like the rest of us. No one stopped to help,\n said my friend. Traffic barely slowed. I do not judge this,\n  \n or even the surreptitious footage of the workers\n somewhere on the killing floor, stomping\n the breast-heavy creatures with their rubber boots.\n How we raise them not to fly, what should waft\n  \n gnostically through the air, the hollowness of evolving.\n My heart is doing that thing again, saying climb the stairs\n on your knees. I tell a friend a man halfway across the world\n has been killed, torn apart by motorbikes, each limb\n tied in a different direction. Could a universe be born this way?\n One minute you are scarping the silvery bark off a birch\n when it comes to you forever and there you lie\n in the bed of a blood-smeared truck at a stoplight\n  \n on Highway 41 because this is the season of messages.\n The man was a teacher. He taught girls.\n When they came for him he told his children\n not to cry. Then the men took out half his bowel,\n the viscera steaming as they do, and they tied him\n ingeniously in such a way that they tore him apart.\n In that other place three million of us died. When I left,\n I left them all behind. In the unfinished mansion\n  \n someone will ask me what I'm thankful for.\n What to say? That one of the most beautiful things\n I have ever seen was a paper nest secreted by wasps,\n and that in the summer I would sleep under it,\n the runnelled mass turning like a planet in the moonlight?\n I will admit I was in favor of war and now look what's happened.\n At the end of the road the man driving the truck will eat\n the deer. If I had to watch someone be torn apart by motorbikes\n  \n I would still be me, which is the horror of it all."

        "Anatomy of Melancholy": "Lucy Doolin, first day on the job, stroked his goateeand informed the seven of us in his chargehis name was short for Lucifer, and that his father, a manhe never knew, had been possessed,as his mother had told him, of both an odd sense of humorand a deep and immitigable bitterness. Also that the same man had named Lucy's twin brother,born dead, Jesus Christ. These facts, he said,along with his tattoos and Mohawked black hair,we should, in our toils on his behalf, remember.As we should also always remember to call himonly by that otherwise most womanly diminutive,and never, he warned, by his given nor surname,least of all with the title \"Mister\" attached,which would remind him of that same most hated fatherand plunge him therefore into a moodhe could not promise he would, he said, \"behave appropriately within.\" Fortunately, our job,unlike the social difficulties attached thereto,was simple: collect the trash from the county's back roads.Although, given Lucy's insistence on thoroughness,this meant not only beer cans and bottles,all manner of cast-off paper and plastics, but alsothe occasional condom too, as well as the festeringroadkill fresh and ridden with maggotry,or desiccate and liftable only from the hot summer tarwith a square-bladed shovel, all of which was to be tossedinto the bed of the township flatbed truck we ourselvesrode to and from the job in. By fifty-yard incrementsthen we traveled. He was never not smoking a cigarette.Late every afternoon, at the dump, while we unloadedour tonnage of trash, he sat with Stump McCarriston,sexton of the dump and the dump's constant resident,in the shade, next to a green, decrepit trailerwe marveled at and strangely envied, since every inchof wall we could see through the open doorwas plastered with fold-outs and pagesfrom every Stump-salvaged Playboy and nudie magazinehe had ever found among the wreckage there.Stump, we understood, was the ugliest man on earth.Even had Lucy not told us so, we would have known,by the olfactory rudeness within twenty yardsof his hovel, that he never bathed. And once,while we shoveled and scraped, he took up the .22from the rack beside his door and poppedwith amazing accuracy three rats not fifty feet from us,then walked to their carcasses, skinned them out,and hung their hides on a scavenged grocery store rackto dry. He was making, Lucy explained, a rat hidecoat we could see, come the fall, except for school.As for school, it was a concept Stump could not fathomand Lucy had no use for, on the truck's dashall that summer Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy,a tome he said he'd read already eleven times,this summer being the twelfth. We thought, in some way,it might have had to do with something like the galleryStump's trailer contained, the first word of its titlemeaning something to us, the last nothing at all.There were things about men we might beunable ever to know, which we somehow knew was lucky.And Lucky, incidentally, was the name of the cat,fat and mangy, that, once Stump was back in the shadewith Lucy, began, one by one, to consume the hideless rats.The town we came from was sinking into the emptinessof a thousand abandoned coal mine shafts beneath it,and rats were more common than haresand universally despised. They shamed us, it seemed,as we were shamed by ignorance and curiosity--the bodies of those women on the walls, the provenanceof rats the very earth offered up like a plague,the burden of a name like Lucifer or Stump,whose name, as it was scrawled on his mailbox,seemed to be Stumplin Reilly McCarriston, Esquire.Of the seven of us, one would die in Vietnam,one, after medical school, would hang himselffrom a beam in his parents' basement, the othersmerely gone, vanished in actuality if not in memory.Leaving me, alone, to tell this story. How Stumpwould spend his last twenty years in prison,having shot Lucy--one slender, flattening .22 slugthrough the forehead--as he stood fifty feet away, balanced atop the tub of an ancient wringer washer,arms extended, like Jesus Christ, said Stump,whose trailer was bulldozed into the dump itselfeven before the trial, and who, no doubt, by somecourt-appointed lawyer if not the appalled sheriff himself,was forced to bathe and shave, to step into the unknown countryof a scentless white shirt and black businessman's trousers,in order to offer his only yet most sincere defense,that Lucifer--Mr. Doolin, as the court insisted--had told him to.",
        "Mowing": "Sleepy and suburban at dusk,\n I learn again the yard's\n geometry, edging around the garden\n and the weedy knots of flowers, circling\n trees and shrubs, giving\n a wide berth to the berry patch,\n heavy and sprawled out of its bounds.\n Shoving such a machine\n around a fairway of dandelions,\n it is easy to feel absurd.\n The average lawn, left alone\n one hundred years, could become\n a hardwood forest. An admirable project.\n Still I carry on, following week on week\n the same mowing pattern, cutting edges,\n almost sprinting the last narrow swaths.\n And tonight, as I mow over\n the bushels of fallen peaches,\n sending pits soaring over the neighbors' fences,\n seems hardly any different.\n But on one crooked march I walk\n across the thin hidden hole\n to a yellowjacket hive. The blade pulls\n them up from their deep sweet chamber\n just as my bare legs go by.\n\n A bee lands heavily,\n all blunder and revenge, and the sting\n is a quick embrace and release,\n like the dared kid's run and touch\n of a blind man. I'm blind now\n with the shock and pain of it,\n howling in a sprint toward the house,\n the mower flopped on its side, wild blade loose\n in the darkening air.\n                                  Later,\n the motor sputtered quiet, starved by tilt,\n I'm back in the twilight,\n a half-dozen stings packed in wet tobacco,\n carrying a can of gasoline, a five-foot torch.\n The destruction is easy: shove can\n slow to entranceway lip, pull\n back and light torch, use torch\n to tip can. One low whump and it's over.\n A few flaming drones flutter out and fall.\n Stragglers, late returners, cruise\n wide circles around the ruins.\n In the cool September night they fly\n or die. In the morning I finish my chores.\n\n All the way to winter the blackened hole\n remains. On Christmas Eve a light\n late snow covers it and all\n the lawn's other imperfections: crabgrass\n hummocks, high maple roots,\n the mushroom-laden fairy ring that defies\n obliteration and appears every spring\n more visible than ever. Standing\n in the window, the scent\n of pine powerful around me,\n the snap of wood undoing itself in the stove,\n I wonder at this thin and cold\n camouflage, falling,\n gradually falling over what has gone\n and grown before. And I hear\n that other rattle and report, that engine\n driven by another fire. I think of a gold\n that is sweet and unguent, a gold\n that is a blaze of years behind me.\n I hear wind in its regular passes\n blowing across the roof,\n feel in my legs a minute and icy tingling,\n as though I have stood too long\n in one place or made again another wrong step,\n as though the present itself\n were a kind of memory, coiled, waiting,\n dying to be seen from tomorrow.",

He'd let me stroke\n his coarse chin whiskers and take\n his soft meaty underlip\n in my hands, press my man's carnivorous\n kiss to his grass-nipping upper half of one, just\n so that I could smell\n the long way his breath had come from the rain\n and the sun, the lungs and the heart,\n from a world that meant no harm.",

In its box   \n of familiar and miraculous inks,   \n a construction of filaments and dust,   \n thoroughfares of worms, and a silage   \n of silverfish husks:   in the autumn light,   \n eight hundred pages of perfect wordless lace.",

For Love, above the head this reddish coil once lavishly wore, there's an air so far away it's sad for me to even think the same sun's rays play where it was and do to you what I would do if I were there or you were here. Still, some thrills remembered do resemble thrills, one hopes, and the ropes of it that gently fell around me bound me so well no hell of miles can defile this dream I dream. I mean the anyway DNA I can find of you. I mean the home of bones and blood that holds the whole of you and which this fizzed-up missive means to conjure, missy, my world in a curl, girl, this man oh man half man I am when you're gone.",
        "Moonlight: Chickens On The Road": "Called out of dream by the pitch and screech,\n I awoke to see my mother's hair\n set free of its pincurls, springing out\n into the still and hurtling air\n above the front seat and just as suddenly gone.\n The space around us twisted,\n and in the instant before the crash\n I heard the bubbling of the chickens,\n the homely racket they make at all speeds,\n signifying calm, resignation, oblivion.\n\n And I listened. All through the slash\n and clatter, the rake of steel, shatter of glass,\n I listened, and what came\n was a blizzard moan in the wind, a wail\n of wreckage, severed hoses and lives,\n a storm of loose feathers, and in the final\n whirl approximating calm, the cluck\n and fracas of the birds. I crawled\n on hands and knees where a window should\n have been and rose uneven\n\n in November dusk. Wind blew\n a snow of down, and rows of it quivered along\n the shoulder. One thin stream of blood\n oozed, flocked in feathers.\n This was in the Ozarks, on a road curving miles\n around Missouri, and as far as I could\n see, no light flickered through the timber,\n no mail box leaned the flag\n of itself toward pavement, no cars\n seemed ever likely to come along.\n\n So I walked, circled the darkening disaster\n my life had come to, and cried.\n I cried for my family there,\n knotted in the snarl of metal and glass;\n for the farmer, looking dead, half in\n and half out of his windshield; and for myself,\n ambling barefoot through the jeweled debris,\n glass slitting little blood-stars in my soles,\n my arm hung loose at the elbow\n and whispering its prophecies of pain.\n\n Around and around the tilted car\n and the steaming truck, around the heap\n of exploded crates, the smears and small hunks\n of chicken and straw. Through\n an hour of loneliness and fear\n I walked, in the almost black of Ozark night,\n the moon just now burning into Missouri. Behind me,\n the chickens followed my lead,\n some fully upright, pecking\n\n the dim pavement for suet or seed,\n some half-hobbled by their wounds, worthless wings\n fluttering in the effort. The faintest\n light turned their feathers phosphorescent,\n and as I watched they came on, as though they believed\n me some savior, some highwayman\n or commando come to save them the last night\n of their clucking lives. This, they must have\n believed, was the end they'd always heard of,\n this the rendering more efficient than the axe,\n\n the execution more anonymous than\n a wringing arm. I walked on, no longer crying,\n and soon the amiable and distracted chattering came\n again, a sound like chuckling, or the backward suck\n of hard laughter. And we walked\n to the cadence their clucking called,\n a small boy towing a cloud around a scene\n of death, coming round and round\n like a dream, or a mountain road,\n like a pincurl, like pulse, like life."

        "Yellow Glove": "What can a yellow glove mean in a world of motorcars and governments?\n\nI was small, like everyone. Life was a string of precautions: Don't kiss the squirrel before you bury him, don't suck candy, pop balloons, drop watermelons, watch TV. When the new gloves appeared one Christmas, tucked in soft tissue, I heard it trailing me: Don't lose the yellow gloves.\n\nI was small, there was too much to remember. One day, waving at a stream--the ice had cracked, winter chipping down, soon we would sail boats and roll into ditches--I let a glove go. Into the stream, sucked under the street. Since when did streets have mouths? I walked home on a desperate road. Gloves cost money. We didn't have much. I would tell no one. I would wear the yellow glove that was left and keep the other hand in a pocket. I knew my mother's eyes had tears they had not cried yet, I didn't want to be the one to make them flow. It was the prayer I spoke secretly, folding socks, lining up donkeys in windowsills. To be good, a promise made to the roaches who scouted my closet at night. If you don't get in my bed, I will be good. And they listened. I had a lot to fulfill.\n\nThe months rolled down like towels out of a machine. I sang and drew and fattened the cat. Don't scream, don't lie, don't cheat, don't fight--you could hear it anywhere. A pebble could show you how to be smooth, tell the truth. A field could show how to sleep without walls. A stream could remember how to drift and change--next June I was stirring the stream like a soup, telling my brother dinner would be ready if he'd only hurry up with the bread, when I saw it. The yellow glove draped on a twig. A muddy survivor. A quiet flag.\n\nWhere had it been in the three gone months? I could wash it, fold it in my winter drawer with its sister, no one in that world would ever know. There were miracles on Harvey Street. Children walked home in yellow light. Trees were reborn and gloves traveled far, but returned. A thousand miles later, what can a yellow glove mean in a world of bankbooks and stereos?\n\nPart of the difference between floating and going down.",

Little as it is, pitiful as it seems,\n this is what they were given, and they don't want to lose it.\n  \n The gawky and the slow, the motley and the misshapen...\n What bliss to be walking in their midst as if I were one of them,\n just ride this gentle wave of idiocy, forget those who profess\n an interest in my welfare, look passing strangers in the eye\n for something we might have in common, and be unconcerned if nothing's there.\n And now we peek into a dark cafe, and now we mug at the waitress\n whose feet are sore, whose smile makes up for the tacky carnations\n and white uniform makes it easy to mistake her for a nurse,\n even makes it necessary, given the state of the world.\n  \n And when the giant with three teeth harangues us to hurry up,\n what comfort to know he's a friend, what pleasure to be agreeable,\n small wonders of acquiescence, like obedient pets.

A dark god, in need\n of a human sacrifice, smoothly turning your back\n on the earnest and their pathetic pleas.\n So the god in me, no stranger to the aberrant\n and the abhorrent, now has no choice\n but to respond in kind. A pity, really,\n since it has been the dream\n of so many gods to find themselves\n in some quiet room, the burden of power\n slipped off and scattered\n like clothes across the floor, the light\n of late afternoon a kind of benediction,\n and everywhere the gratitude\n for the privilege of feeling\n almost human.",

They approximate the rippling surface of a river pregnant with water and smoothly traveling towards an orb of sea salt. His pen is a black crow against a sunlit sky. Its ink is harsh, blotting paper, even with the neat economy of motion in how the ink is laid. For a moment, a golden spark glints from a cufflink struck by a sun ray. Meticulously, the ink travels from point to point, dipping, then rising, then dipping again until it is halted by one of the four walls of a square. The paper mottles. He lays the pen besides the projection of a likelihood as an ache begins between his shoulder blades. As he rolls his head in a circle, he considers the placement of a decimal point. Lastly, he considers the definition of a percentage to be the probability of error instead of the probability of an answer's relevance.\n\n*\nIt seems a secretary with large hair is shuffling until he notices that it is only a tight skirt hampering her thighs. He begins to feel the papers stacked on a crudenza curling their edges to protest being ignored. A lock of hair falls in front of his eyeballs and he notices a white feather. He immediately comprehends how long it has been since scissors tip-toed about his scalp. Bereft, he looks at his desk and is astonished at how still his fingers lie atop a yellow pad--he would have sworn his fear would have left his empty palms quaking at how time is consistently ending.\n\n*\nHe looks up to be surprised at midnight \"a done deal.\" His hands seek release and he wipes them against the pin-striped wool encasing his thighs. A woman with a blurred face atop a blue silk shirt pops her head through the door. He knows she is speaking but his gaze cannot locate the source of the buzzing. He feels a fleeting thought of inebriated bees, how they might blunder with pollen gratuitously. His gaze falls to the circle of diamonds on her left, blue-veined wrist. He takes a chance and replies, \"Yes.\" It is sufficient to make her go away so that all that remains across his threshold is the shadow of a door. He feels he must complete the job by shutting a door but he is so tired.\n\n*\nWas I ever a boy? he asks himself as he watches the Chairman hold hands with his tall wife. The wife smiles but it is clear she is dangling her legs over a pedestal. When he reaches them for an obligatory greeting, he realizes (without being surprised at the certainty of this thought) that she smells expensive. He hears her emerald earrings tinkle like wind chimes. His breath is the breeze against her pale, seamless skin. She smiles at him and he feels even smaller. His breath is the flutter of a Trochilidae's wings. When he next turns to the Chairman, he is buffeted by the Chairman's smug grin.\n\n*\nHe tattoos his fingerprints on the most random of surfaces. It happens that way each morning when he must read six newspapers beside The Wall Street Journal. One is in Japanese. Another in German. He cannot recall the last time he was lucid. He cuts himself shaving whenever the mirror reminds him that his eyes are covered by red cracks. They remind him of bigger faultlines just waiting to widen. He knows he will fold into himself during the fall. He feels that avoidance should be under his control. But it is not happening and he is often immobilized by this failure.\n\n*\nI should fall in love, he thinks, as he reads a worn newspaper clipping. It has traveled throughout the firm and reached him at last. He flinches at the leers clinging to the message. His fingers feel wet though the clipping is dry. The clipping is about Alan \"Swift\" Thiessen, the man who once sat in an office down the hall. Once, Swift was a tight muscle tightly sheathed in Italian suits with double-breasted blazers, a sartorial sun amidst the human commodities forging together a partnership. It was an eccentricity allowed by Swift's ability to bleed rain from desiccated clients. Once, Swift also played squash every day. Now, Swift is clad in rough cotton and measures each passing moment in a jail, staring at rust and bricks. The newspaper reports how Swift went too far with a young, blonde boy sheathed in leather with metal studs. Still, The Investment Banker suggests to himself that he fall in love. Despite Swift's ignominious end, he feels that Swift still bested him by having felt certain compulsions about which he can only remain curious.\n\n*\nAt 4 a.m. he is not displeased to be alone walking the streets. At 4 a.m., he feels that the hour offers a certain excuse for his loneliness. Now, he is walking in the aftermath of an unseasonal rain so that the light is clean and the pavement shines from the wash of water. The tall buildings conspire to maintain sufficient lights to surround him like Christmas. He notices a white flower in a bud vase by a window he passes. It is unexpected but pleasing and he pauses to think, Hello! He knows he is imagining things but he senses the flower open its petals a tad wider. His nostrils flare at the inexplicable perfume of jasmine. He looks forward to winter when snow will cover the city. Even in a blizzard, the snow is constant. They never fail to cling softly to him as he walks in their midst. He feels, It is such a loving feeling."

        "Book Review: The Mountain Lion by Jean Stafford": "Spoiler alert: in this all-but-forgotten\n masterwork, Jean Stafford--who was once\n widely regarded as the leading novelist\n  \n of her generation, and who wrote\n this perverse, short,\n lyrical novel, her second, during\n  \n the flailing failings\n of her marriage to my hero\n Robert Lowell--kills\n  \n Molly, her child-alter ego,\n a girl too unloved and unloving\n to survive puberty, too\n  \n pure and awful--like Stafford, who died\n pickled and childish three\n decades later after winning\n  \n the Pulitzer with her devastating,\n hurtfully compassionate Collected \nStories--for this or any other world,\n  \n especially the necessarily\n allegorical one of fiction.\n I am broken now, hopeless; hope\n  \n is proved by this book to be\n a contrivance. I have just\n read the last pages in which\n  \n Molly's brother, Ralph--who,\n to live, cannot love\n either, has no spare love--shoots\n  \n her, aiming for the wild mountain\n lion whose stuffed corpse\n was to be the triumph\n  \n of his new manhood. I don't\n hate Ralph--how can I, a boy,\n mistaken, like me? And can I hate\n  \n Molly, who so needed Ralph\n and everyone, still young enough to savor\n the bittersweet of her anger?\n  \n What about Stafford, who hurt\n herself, all our selves, with\n this ending, her classic tragedy, writing,\n  \n decades later, Poor old \nMolly! I loved her dearly \nand I hope she rests in peace.\n  \n Fuck insight and analysis:\n my heart is shot. Why\n did she have to die? Why does\n  \n anyone? Why do you, do I?\n Because of what Ralph was\n feeling just before he accidentally\n  \n slaughtered the future? This book\n must have ravaged the already\n sleepless poet Gregory Orr,\n  \n who shot his brother, too, and\n suffers that endless error\n in poetry and prose. And because Molly\n  \n refused everything, she stood between\n Ralph and tomorrow. But he grew, he\n changed. Confused? Read\n  \n the book. In novels\n people die because of what they feel.\n In life, people die when\n  \n their bodies conk out,\n exhausted machines that living\n expends. And what\n  \n happens when people feel\n their feelings in life?\n Nothing? Anything? Brenda,\n  \n dear Brenda, my love, nothing\n happens, I'm afraid. I'm sorry. And afraid.\n A small breeze born in the heart\n  \n gently bends a blade of grass\n and no one hears a word.\n No one reads Stafford anymore--I asked\n  \n on Facebook. Stafford died, her\n legacy gently dispatched\n into the low air. O, life\n  \n is terrible, literature\n ridiculous. Stafford's prose,\n teeming and rich as loam,\n  \n could take Famous Franzen's\n for a walk, feed it biscuits.\n But who cares? Who remembers?\n  \n O, to have been Jean Stafford,\n in the past I idealize, when the world\n was less self-conscious, less\n  \n precise. I could be\n dead already, warmish\n beneath a blanket of dust. Joyful\n  \n are the faded, the once-greats\n whose afterlives slipped out\n a hole in posterity's pocket:\n  \n they are loved poignantly by\n a needy few. O, to be kept\n cozy in the bosoms of those\n  \n desperate and proud, forgotten\n for all the good I do. Love\n is sunlight streaming unevenly\n  \n through the canopy of leaves\n overhead. We can only grow\n in the brighter patches below, fading\n  \n where light is thin. Molly,\n we are with you, nowhere and gone.\n Mostly we are forgotten, too."

Under\n those trees, a short distance from the house\n\nas nowhere else in the picture, a moment\n of repose, the sun on the warm bark, the circle\nof cool beneath. But the bird holds us fast,\n a shadow cast by moonlight, the flowers\nbeside it articulate as the delphiniums\n in La Primavera, at the Uffizi, at which we\n\npaused until we could look no longer at\n an extreme propensity for beauty, as though it\nmight explode in smithereens. Autumn,\n the seed pods are moth-eaten moons, dry, rattling.\nIn Wyeth's more famous picture, the girl\n stranded in the foreground in a clutch of weeds\n\nher awkward limbs stretching in the hissing grass\n is in the same place in the picture plane\nas the blackbird, we all agreed with this,\n the woman in the white hat -- why a hat,\ninside the museum -- and her friend, smaller,\n dressed all in black, black shoes, black stockings,\n\nblack dress, although it is summer.\n At once we want to help her as she reaches\nthe unbridgeable distance of the field\n and the meadow filled with rough grass\nalthough it's not so evident how to help her\n for even now our heavy limbs twitch with\n\nenchantment, caught in a dream in which\n it is impossible to move except by slithering.\nIn my sleep you said I said -- too many people.\n The black house is a ship on the horizon,\nevery light on, or the moon that looks\n as if it is following us but from which\n\nwe are always veering away, the white wolf\n snapping at our heels, goading us to cross\nthe bridge or waiting for us by the water\n its white face wavering under the pilings.\nThe girl is a blackbird in the high grass,\n it is natural to mistake one for the other\n\n when it is so difficult despite the painter's\n efforts, herculean, really, to see clearly --\n\n   \n \n vi saturday night (at the ballet)\n\n        Puck, above a game of flashlight tag\n the tiniest fairy pirouetting like a dervish --\n the honeysuckle wood alit, one pointed\n green-shod foot dangling, like the hand that reached\n down to Francis to pull him up to heaven\n or rebuke him, or the white hand coming\n out of the darkness over the ring: counting\none, two, three, alley, alley, innisfree --\n the three goats balking at the bridge, Father\n bellowing over the rushing water\n the river loud, rearing its head, foam rushing past\n its eyes and ears, Father clamoring, needing\n something -- the moment we know\nit has come to nothing.\n\n   \n \n vii (the dream)\n\nThe heavens shift.\n And presto! the tilted abacus\n of stars slides back in place, twilight's worn edge rubbed\n to a sheen. Queen, ass, Indian child, love-lit quartet, slipping\n    as the constellations do\nbehind Gaia's unearthly tilt\n    leaving us in night's cooler, less demanding air\nwhere our taxi driver has his phone\n on speaker: twenty minutes of harangue,\n     a hornet trapped inside a troika, the driver\nsilent except once to say,\n    interrupting the ceaseless string of epithets,\n\n\"You are the women of my dreams.\"\n            Lights turn from red to green,\n the avenue slick before the curb. Remember? The crescent\n moon scar on my knee --\n            Rain patters the windshield, the lights\n     from the bodega spatter lime and pink.\n              A folded scene.\nAbove, the moon --\n              another night before a halt.\n\n  \n viii evening and morning\n\nMorning lit by evening's lantern, the cat\n a baby falling from the broken bough,\n childhood's terrible litter of fear.\nI am the goat and the goat is me. I see the moon,\nthe moon sees me. And if I die before I wake,\n the spirit leaving the body as we sleep\n as Giacomo said in the gospel -- who said it, where?\n if the spirit leaves my body where does it go?\n -- and in the dark the pine knots watching\n and your eyes big in the dark, and the sound of breathing.\n In your sleep you said too many people.\n I woke you in the dark and I took you by the hand --\n How far is the moon? If I folded this piece of paper?\n But then you would never get there, remember?\n And your total disregard of me --\n twilight's rainbow a lasso fetching the moon from the water --\n When I was walking I fell from the curb.\n You did not. I did, I did.\n  \n   \n \n ix the cove\n\n The three children not far off\n cross the road to the water\n and into the hot high grass,\n their feet light on the flattened\n stalks of the cattails that line\n the swale like pale raffia\n woven expressly for that\n  \n purpose, as if the landscape\n was a diorama made\n of glassine, straw, and folded\n paper. Whose children are they --\n one, two, three, walking to\n the ruined, silvery, splintery\n boat, that looks like a whale come\n  \n ashore in the pocket cove\n which opens at high tide like\n a giantess's compact?\n There is another smaller\n shadow, pulling a kite -- or\n no, a pull-toy dog, which barks\n at an upturned horseshoe crab\n  \n and a stained, eyeless, gray-brown\n gull. How oddly sound travels\n over water. Underfoot\n the sun-crazed hermit crabs run\n helter-skelter to their bomb\n shelters under the wet sand,\n where at dead low tide the marsh\n  \n makes a kind of long, humped bridge\n of itself to the rapt cove\n and the ruined quiet. Psst says\n the wind. The children run at\n it, lowing their heads, making\n horns with their fingers, bashing\n themselves in it and through it.\n\n  \n x case sensitive\n\n Two days I've forgotten where I'm going,\n New York's crossword up and down a litter\n of numbers and letters. I spin on the grid,\n round hole in a square peg, each step a rope\n bridge hung in air, my tongue a troll who eats\n my words, my goat-fur cloak held fast by Pysche's\n brooch. \"Smile, libling, you have your whole life\n ahead of you.\" Hold on tight. Even the dead\n won't speak to me, my sharp hooves beating\n the bank's slick grass, the bog oak's muddy rune.\n Bee disheveled on the stairs, the storm\n rattling the panes. \"I dreamed I walked and walked\nand could not find my way.\" Dear God, let me\n keep my dreams to myself and do no harm."

I understood the need for tea\n and the luxury of cremes and pastries\n and why the ladies longed for a strong shoulder\n to see them through the winter.\n The seagulls cried overhead,\n though there was no sea, only a muddy river\n from Bath to Bristol. The scavengers\n lived on the rooftops and if desperate\n enough would swoop down and take\n a sandwich from your hand.\n I secured my room at the Royal Bath Hotel.\n It was a hovel, really, with a carpet\n as old as the early century.\n Walking through the hotel,\n I sensed something lurid\n in the air, every eye upon me as if they knew\n I was a foreigner in a strange land.\n Over the bed, a burgundy bedspread\n dusty and faded as vintage wine,\n made me long for the bright color of red.\n In the next room, sleepless, I heard\n through thin walls the sounds\n of an un-tender coupling.\n I looked in the warped mirror\n and found myself ugly\n and when I turned from it,\n could not escape the vision.\n It lingered. The rain came and went,\n came and went. I took an umbrella\n and began my walk, hoping to come upon\n her quarters.

The whole world seemed to agree--\n as the late April sky deepened through the afternoon\n into high August blue, the vapour trails of two planes\n converged to sketch a cross on the brow of heaven.\n My brother Kit and I kept our backs turned to that\n except now and again.

Then the nurse looked in: Nothing will change\nhere for a while boys, and we ducked out like criminals.\n  \n I was ordering two large gins in the pub half a mile off\n when my mobile rang. It was the hospital. You had died.\n I put my drink down, then thought again and finished it.\n Five minutes later we were back at the door of your room\n wondering whether to knock.

        "A Moment of Reflection": "28 June 1914\n\n\n\nAlthough an assassin has tried\n and failed to blow him to pieces earlier this morning,\n Archduke Ferdinand has let it be known\n he will very soon complete his journey\n as planned along the quay in Sarajevo.\n  \n For a moment, however,\n he has paused to recover his composure\n at the window of a private room in the Town Hall,\n after finding the blood of his aide-de-camp\n spattered over the manuscript of the speech\n he was previously unable to complete.\n  \n And indeed,\n the prospect of an Austrian brewery in the distance\n is reassuring,\n likewise the handsome bulk of the barracks\n filled with several thousand soldiers of the fatherland.\n  \n This is how those who survive today will remember him:\n  \n a man thinking his thoughts\n until his wife has finished her duties--\n the Countess Chotek, with her pinched yet puddingy features,\n to whom he will whisper shortly,\n 'Sophie, live for our children',\n although she will not hear.\n  \n As for his own memories:\n  \n the Head of the local Tourist Bureau has now arrived\n and taken it upon himself to suggest\n the Archduke might be happy to recall the fact\n that only last week he bagged his three thousandth stag.\n  \n Was this, the Head dares to enquire,\n with the double-barrelled Mannlicher\n made for him especially--\n the same weapon he used to dispatch\n two thousand one hundred and fifty game birds\n in a single day,\n and sixty boars in a hunt led by the Kaiser?\n  \n These are remarkable achievements\n the Head continues,\n on the same level as the improvement\n the Archduke has suggested in the hunting of hare,\n by which the beaters,\n forming themselves into a wedge-shape,\n squeeze those notoriously elusive creatures\n towards a particular spot\n where he can exceed the tally of every other gun.\n  \n In the silence that follows\n it is not obvious whether the Archduke\n has heard the question.\n  \n He has heard it.\n  \n He is more interested, however,\n in what these questions bring to mind:\n  \n an almost infinite number of woodcock,\n pigeon, quail, pheasant and partridge,\n wild boars bristling flank to flank,\n mallard and teal and geese\n dangling from the antlers of stags,\n layer and layer of rabbits\n and other creatures that are mere vermin--\n  \n a haul that he predicts will increase\n once the business of today has been completed.",

They turned out to be\n  \n reciting poetry. 'My life', said the interpreter, 'is like a bag of flour\n thrown through wind into empty thorn bushes'. Then 'No, no', he said,\n correcting himself.

I\n do not know.\n I was thinking how neat he is.\n I was asking myself:\n will I be like this? How will I manage?\n  \n After that he chooses a log\n from the wicker wood-basket\n to balance on the coals,\n and admires his handiwork.\n  \n When the time comes to follow him,\n glide, glide over the polished floor,\n he leads the way to the dustbins.\n  \n A breath of ash\n pours continuously over his shoulder\n from the pan he carries before him\n like a man bearing a gift\n in a picture of a man bearing a gift.",

        "How to Cook Rice": "Measure two handfuls for a prosperous man.\n Place in pot and wash by rubbing palms together\n as if you can't quite get yourself to pray, or\n by squeezing it in one fist.

This method of measuring water will work\n regardless of the size of the pot; if the pot is large,\n use both hands palms down as if to pat your own belly.\n Now place on high heat without cover and cook\n until the water has been boiled away except in craters\n resembling those of the moon, important\n in ancient times for growing rice. Now place lid on top\n and reduce heat to medium, go read your newspaper\n until you get to the comics, then come back and turn it down to low.\n The heat has been gradually traveling from the outside\n to the inside of the rice, giving it texture;\n a similar thing happens with people, I suppose.\n  \n Go back to your newspaper, finish the comics, and read\n the financial page. Now the rice is done, but before\n you eat, consider the peasant who arcs in leech-infested\n paddies and who carefully plants the rice seedlings\n one by one; on this night, you are eating better than he.\n If you still don't know how to cook rice, buy a Japanese\n automatic rice cooker; it makes perfect rice every time!"

        "What the Oracle Said": "You will leave your home:\n nothing will hold you.\n You will wear dresses of gold; skins\n of silver, copper, and bronze.\n The sky above you will shift in meaning\n each time you think you understand.\n You will spend a lifetime chipping away layers\n of flesh. The shadow of your scales\n will always remain. You will be marked\n by sulphur and salt.\n You will bathe endlessly in clear streams and fail\n to rid yourself of that scent.\n Your feet will never be your own.\n Stone will be your path.\n Storms will follow in your wake,\n destroying all those who take you in.\n You will desert your children\n kill your lovers and devour their flesh.\n You will love no one\n but the wind and ache of your bones.\n Neither will love you in return.\n With age, your hair will grow matted and dull,\n your skin will gape and hang in long folds,\n your eyes will cease to shine.\n But nothing will be enough.\n The sea will never take you back.",
        "The Art Room": "for my sisters\n\n\n\nBecause we did not have threads\n of turquoise, silver, and gold,\n we could not sew a sun nor sky.\n And our hands became balls of fire.\n And our arms spread open like wings.\n\n Because we had no chalk or pastels,\n no toad, forest, or morning-grass slats\n of paper, we had no colour\n for creatures. So we squatted\n and sprang, squatted and sprang.\n\n Four young girls, plaits heavy\n on our backs, our feet were beating\n drums, drawing rhythms from the floor;\n our mouths became woodwinds;\n our tongues touched teeth and were reeds."

By the spider\n It has been bound tightly and tied\n In an eight-stringed knot.\n\n The sun has been intercepted in its one\n Basic state and changed to a million varieties\n Of green stick and tassel. It has been broken\n Into pieces by glass rings, by mist\n Over the river. Its heat\n Has been given the board fence for body,\n The desert rock for fact. On winter hills\n It has been laid down in white like a martyr.\n\n This afternoon we could spread gold scarves\n Clear across the field and say in truth,\n \"Sun you are silk.\"\n\n Imagine the sun totally isolated,\n Its brightness shot in continuous streaks straight out\n Into the black, never arrested,\n Never once being made light.\n\n Someone should take note\n Of how the earth has saved the sun from oblivion.",

They have confronted sulfuric    boiling black sea bottoms and stayed,     held on under ten tons of polar ice,    established themselves in dense salts    and acids, survived eating metal ions.    They are more committed than oblivion,    more prolific than stars.   Far too ancient for scripture, each  one bears in its one cell one text--  the first whit of alpha, the first    jot of bearing, beneath the riling    sun the first nourishing of self.      Too lavish for saints, too trifling    for baptism, they have existed    throughout never gaining girth enough    to hold a firm hope of salvation.  Too meager in heart for compassion,  too lean for tears, less in substance  than sacrifice, not one has ever    carried a cross anywhere.   And not one of their trillions    has ever been given a tombstone.    I've never noticed a lessening    of light in the ceasing of any one    of them. They are more mutable    than mere breathing and vanishing,    more mysterious than resurrection,    too minimal for death."

        "Lifting My Daughter": "As I leave for work she holds out her arms, and I\n bend to lift her . . . always heavier than I remember,\n because in my mind she is still that seedling bough\n I used to cradle in one elbow. Her hug is honest,\n fierce, forgiving. I think of Oregon's coastal pines,\n wind-bent even on quiet days; they've grown in ways\n the Pacific breeze has blown them all their lives.\n And how will my daughter grow? Last night, I dreamed\n of a mid-ocean gale, a howl among writhing waterspouts;\n I don't know what it meant, or if it's still distant,\n or already here. I know only how I hug my daughter,\n my arms grown taut with the thought of that wind.",

Moments later,\n the sign blinks, winks dark,\n\n and a white-aproned cook--\n surfacing in the murky sheen\n\n of the window--leans awhile\n like a cut lily . . . staring out\n\n into the famished blankness\n he knows he must go home to."

        "Losses": "It must be difficult for God, listening\n to our voices come up through his floor\n of cloud to tell Him what's been taken away:\n Lord, I've lost my dog, my period, my hair,\n all my money. What can He say, given\n we're so incomplete we can't stop being\n surprised by our condition, while He\n is completeness itself? Or is God more\n like us, made in His image--shaking His head\n because He can't be expected to keep track\n of which voice goes with what name and address,\n He being just one God. Either way, we seem\n to be left here to discover our losses, everything\n from car keys to larger items we can't search\n our pockets for, destined to face them\n on our own. Even though the dentist gives us\n music to listen to and the assistant looks down\n with her lovely smile, it's still our tooth\n he yanks out, leaving a soft spot we ponder\n with our tongue for days. Left to ourselves,\n we always go over and over what's missing--\n tooth, dog, money, self-control, and even losses\n as troubling as the absence the widower can't stop\n reaching for on the other side of his bed a year\n later. Then one odd afternoon, watching something\n as common as the way light from the window\n lingers over a vase on the table, or how the leaves\n on his backyard tree change colors all at once\n in a quick wind, he begins to feel a lightness,\n as if all his loss has led to finding just this.\n Only God knows where the feeling came from,\n or maybe God's not some knower off on a cloud,\n but there in the eye, which tears up now\n at the strangest moments, over the smallest things.",
        "The Puppy": "From down the road, starting up\n and stopping once more, the sound\n of a puppy on a chain who has not yet\n discovered he will spend his life there.\n Foolish dog, to forget where he is\n and wander until he feels the collar\n close fast around his throat, then cry\n all over again about the little space\n in which he finds himself. Soon,\n when there is no grass left in it\n and he understands it is all he has,\n he will snarl and bark whenever\n he senses a threat to it.\n Who would believe this small\n sorrow could lead to such fury\n no one would ever come near him?",

He is the one I think of now,\n lifting the tray for my family,\n the guests, until at last he comes\n to me. And I, no less confused,\n look down from his hurt eyes as if\n there were nothing between us\n except an arrangement of cheese,\n and not this bafflement, these\n almost tender hands that once\n swung hammers and drove machines\n and insisted that I learn to be a man.",
        "Hymn to the Comb-Over": "How the thickest of them erupt just   above the ear, cresting in waves so stiff   no wind can move them.   Let us praise them   in all of their varieties, some skinny   as the bands of headphones, some rising   from a part that extends halfway around   the head, others four or five strings   stretched so taut the scalp resembles   a musical instrument.   Let us praise the sprays   that hold them, and the combs that coax   such abundance to the front of the head   in the mirror, the combers entirely forget   the back.   And let us celebrate the combers,   who address the old sorrow of time's passing   day after day, bringing out of the barrenness   of mid-life this ridiculous and wonderful   harvest, no wishful flag of hope, but, thick,   or thin, the flag itself, unfurled for us all   in subways, offices, and malls across America.",
        "For My Wife": "How were we to know, leaving your two kids\n behind in New Hampshire for our honeymoon\n at twenty-one, that it was a trick of cheap\n hotels in New York City to draw customers\n like us inside by displaying a fancy lobby?\n Arriving in our fourth-floor room, we found\n a bed, a scarred bureau, and a bathroom door\n with a cut on one side the exact shape\n of the toilet bowl that was in its way\n when I closed it. I opened and shut the door,\n admiring the fit and despairing of it. You\n discovered the initials of lovers carved\n on the bureau's top in a zigzag, breaking heart.\n How wrong the place was to us then,\n unable to see the portents of our future\n that seem so clear now in the naivete\n of the arrangements we made, the hotel's\n disdain for those with little money,\n the carving of pain and love. Yet in that room\n we pulled the covers over ourselves and lay\n our love down, and in this way began our unwise\n and persistent and lucky life together.",
        "When She Wouldn't": "When her recorded voice on the phone said who she was again and again to the piles of newspapers and magazines and the clothes in the chairs and the bags of unopened mail and garbage and piles of unwashed dishes.When she could no longer walk through the stench of it, in her don't-need-nobody-to-help-me way of walking, with her head bent down to her knees as if she were searching for a dime that had rolled into a crack on the floor, though it was impossible to see the floor. When the pain in her foot she disclosedto no one was so bad she could not stand at her refrigerator packed with food and sniff to find what was edible. When she could hardly even sit as she loved to sit, all night on the toilet, with the old rinsed diapers hanging nearby on the curtainless bar of the shower stall, and the shoes lined upin the tub, falling asleep and waking up while she cut out newspaper clippings and listened to the late-night talk on her crackling radio about alien landings and why the government had denied them. When she drew the soapy rag across the agonizing ache of her foot trying over and over to washthe black from her big toe and could notbecause it was gangrene.  When at last they came to carry my mother out of the wilderness of that houseand she lay thin and frail and disorientedbetween bouts of tests and X-rays, and I came to find her in the white bed of her white room among nurses who brushed her hair while she looked up at them and smiledwith her yellow upper plate that seemed to holdher face together, dazed and disbelieving, as if she were in heaven, then turned, still smiling, to the door where her stout, bestroked younger brother teetered into the room on his cane, all the way from Missouri with her elderly sister and her bald-headed baby brother, whom she despised. When he smiled backand dipped his bald head down to kiss her, and her sister and her other brother hugged herwith serious expressions, and her childish astonishment slowly changed to suspicion and the old wildness returnedto her eye because she began to see this was not what she wanted at all, I sitting down by her good ear holding her hand to talk to her about going into the homethat was not her home, her baby brother winking,the others nodding and saying, Listen to Wesley. When it became clear to her that we were not her people, the ones she had left behind in her house, on the radio, in the newspaper clippings, in the bags of unopened mail, in her mind, and she turned her face away so I could see the print of red on her cheek as if she had been slapped hard. When the three of them began to implore their older sister saying, Ruth, Ruth, and We come out here for your own good, and That time rolls around for all of us, getting frustrated and mad because they meant, but did not know they meant, themselves too.When the gray sister, the angriest of them, finally said through her pleated lips and lower plate, You was always the stubborn one, we ain't here to poison you, turn around and say something. When she wouldn't.",

        "A Story Can Change Your Life": "On the morning she became a young widow,\n my grandmother, startled by a sudden shadow,\n looked up from her work to see a hawk turn\n her prized rooster into a cloud of feathers.\n That same moment, halfway around the world\n in a Minnesota mine, her husband died,\n buried under a ton of rockfall.\n She told me this story sixty years ago.\n I don't know if it's true but it ought to be.\n She was a hard old woman, and though she knelt\n on Sundays when the acolyte's silver bell\n announced the moment of Christ's miracle,\n it was the darker mysteries she lived by:\n shiver-cry of an owl, black dog by the roadside,\n a tapping at the door and nobody there.\n The moral of the story was plain enough:\n miracles become a burden and require a priest\n to explain them. With signs, you only need\n to keep your wits about you and place your trust\n in a shadow world that lets you know hard luck\n and grief are coming your way. And for that\n --so the story goes--any day will do.",
        "After the Funeral": "We opened closets and bureau drawers\n and packed away, in boxes, dresses and shoes,\n the silk underthings still wrapped in tissue.\n We sorted through cedar chests. We gathered\n and set aside the keepsakes and the good silver\n and brought up from the coal cellar\n jars of tomato sauce, peppers, jellied fruit.\n We dismantled, we took down from the walls,\n we bundled and carted off and swept clean.\n Goodbye, goodbye, we said, closing\n the door behind us, going our separate ways\n from the house we had emptied,\n and which, in the coming days, we would fill\n again and empty and try to fill again.",
        "The Girl on the Bullard Overpass": "The girl on the Bullard overpass\n looks happy to be there, getting soaked\n in a light rain but waving her hands\n to the four o'clock freeway traffic\n in which I'm anything but happy.\n\n You might think she's too dumb\n to come in out of the rain, but rain\n or shine, it doesn't seem to matter.\n She's there most every afternoon,\n as if she does this for a living.\n\n Some living, I'd say. Doesn't she ever\n get bored, or wish someone would stop\n and say, \"Where to?\" and her life would change?\n That's how I'd be, hating the noise,\n the stink of exhaust, the press of people.\n\n I can't imagine what her life is;\n mine is confused and often fretful.\n But there's something brave about standing alone\n in the rain, waving wild semaphores\n of gladness to impatient passersby\n\n too tired or preoccupied to care.\n Seeing her at her familiar station\n I suddenly grin like a fool, wave back,\n and forgive the driver to my right,\n who is sullen and staring as I pass.\n\n I find her in my rear-view mirror,\n then head for a needed drink and supper.\n I don't know where she goes, but I hope\n it's to a place she loves. I hope the rain\n lets up. I hope she's there tomorrow.",
        "A Small Story": "When Mrs. McCausland comes to mind\n she slips through a small gap in oblivion\n and walks down her front steps, in her hand\n a small red velvet pillow she tucks\n under the head of Old Jim Schreiber,\n who is lying dead-drunk against the curb\n of busy Market Street. Then she turns,\n labors up the steps and is gone . . .\n\n A small story. Or rather, the memory\n of a story I heard as a boy. The witnesses\n are not to be found, the steps lead nowhere,\n the pillow has collapsed into a thread of dust . . .\n Do the dead come back only to remind us\n they, too, were once among the living,\n and that the story we make of our lives\n is a mystery of luminous, but uncertain moments,\n a shuffle of images we carry toward sleep--\n Mrs. McCausland with her velvet pillow,\n Old Jim at peace--a story, like a small\n clearing in the woods at night, seen\n from the windows of a passing train.",
        "Rain": "Toward evening, as the light failed\n and the pear tree at my window darkened,\n I put down my book and stood at the open door,\n the first raindrops gusting in the eaves,\n a smell of wet clay in the wind.\n Sixty years ago, lying beside my father,\n half asleep, on a bed of pine boughs as rain\n drummed against our tent, I heard\n for the first time a loon's sudden wail\n drifting across that remote lake--\n a loneliness like no other,\n though what I heard as inconsolable\n may have been only the sound of something\n untamed and nameless\n singing itself to the wilderness around it\n and to us until we slept. And thinking of my father\n and of good companions gone\n into oblivion, I heard the steady sound of rain\n and the soft lapping of water, and did not know\n whether it was grief or joy or something other\n that surged against my heart\n and held me listening there so long and late."

        "An After Hour": "When one thing is becoming another, when writing is morphing, when the writing of an hour becomes the desire to write at all hours and into the night, fueled on caffeine or wine and desiring instruments of writing; typewriters, even a nib and ink well, and considering all the ways of stretching a space, digital or hard copy; hard copy, an ugly expression for printed matter, and for that matter, printed matter is efficient but lacks beauty. Page, a soft and elongated word; page, an extension at the end of my fingers; page, a screen that holds dreams and desires; the page of legal document that bind. The page is a promise. I read all sides, turning the page counterclockwise and turning the page over for what I may have missed.\nDesire is a stick for scratching words into the dirt and for chiseling stone until the words become solid. The pen is a body, an anatomy, not an earthworm with indecipherable ends; the pen has a head and tail, and inky guts. And the brain of the pen belongs to the maker of marks.\nlater hours/another hour/late hours/early hours/happy hour/visiting hours.\n\nAll the elements of the dying hour surround my laptop, in the dying blades of cut grass and in the dying battery. Finches continue their making of a nest of twigs and grasses, but I know the nest is early paper, the raw ingredients and pulp. I know the world is a page turner, a paper globe, and I know that the birds are the great writers of the sky."

        "Notes: Coercive Counterintelligence Interrogation of Resistant Sources": "HOW TO SUCCEED IN TORTURE \n WITHOUT REALLY TRYING\n\n 1. FIRST THINGS FIRST: \n\n Surprise,\n             catch your source off balance\n            when he least expects it:\nAt the moment he opens his eyes in the morning\n While he shits on the can. \n\n Detain and confine,\n\n                       quickly, \n      quickly\n\n             cut him off from the known. \n\n Plunge your source into the strange, \n\n                       the invisible wells gone dry in his bones\nDrained by his eyes\n\n          He's in occupied territory--\n\n             he could walk a long time and find nowhere, nothing, nada\n\n                   no doors, no tunnels, windows\n \n 2. KEEP IT SIMPLE: \n         \n       Familiar clothing reinforces identity. \n\n        Replace the source's attire with items several sizes too large. \n\n        Shave off his hair. \n\n        Confiscate his belt; make him hold up his pants. \n\n         Best of all, keep him naked, especially from the waist down. \n\n 3. YOUR GOALS: \n\n         Identify, expose and exploit the resistant source's internal \n            hungers.\n\n         Induce the source to fluctuate inside himself. \n\n         Befuddle the source's anxiety with constant, sudden\n         disruptions of patterns, blurs and howling winds. \n\n         Make sure the source's body is havoc and there is no escape. \n\n         Play the role of superior external/paternal power geared to\n         crush the source's will and extract a true confession. \n\n        NOTA BENE: the interrogator, by virtue of his role as the sole \n         donor of satisfaction and punishment, may take on the stature\n         and importance of a father figure--the one the source loves but\n         hates and wants to castrate. Intense hatred and warm feelings\n        often make faithful friends. \n\n 4. REGRESSION AS RORSCHACH: \n\n When the binding ropes are released and\n  the course is dropped one foot, \n\n  then another foot, then again, \n  and so on and so on, \n\n  the rhythm of elevation, descent, known as \"squassation\",\n  reach its climax when the source's torso\n\n  lands in the fetal pose. \n\n 5. MIND YOUR P's and Q's: \n          \n         Full-blown DDD (depression, debility, dread) syndrome\n         constitutes a state of discomfort that is well nigh intolerable. \n\n         The source sinks into defensive apathy from which it is hard \n         to arouse him. \n\n         Marshal your quick wit, good judgment and perfect timing \n         to prevent such collapse. \n\n 6. THE BEAUTY OF ISOLATION: \n\n         A cell that is soundproof, odorless, and totally dark can\n         produce results in a few hours or days, while detention in \n         an ordinary cell may produce only after weeks or\n        months of confinement. \n\n        Speedy onset of anxiety is of great benefit to you in fulfilling \n        your mission. \n\n         Finally, bear in mind a water tank or iron lung is more\n         effective than a cell. \n\n 7. DURESS, COMPLIANCE, REGRESSION\n ARE THE HOLY TRINITY OF COERCIVE \n INTERROGATION: \n\n         You are in the service of your country. \n\n         You are helping to make the world a better place."

No,\n She'd trust no one but herself, her own\n New lean always jittering legs to carry her--\n Where exactly? Where would a child go?\n To there. There alone. She'd rest one elbow\n On the table--the opposite one to the bent leg\n Skimming the solid expensive tasteful chair.\n And even though we were together, her eyes\n Would go half-dome, shades dropped\n Like a screen at some cinema the old aren't\n Let into. I thought I'd have more time! I thought\n My body would have taken longer going\n About the inevitable feat of repelling her,\n But now, I could see even in what food\n She left untouched, food I'd bought and made\n And all but ferried to her lips, I could see\n How it smacked of all that had grown slack\n And loose in me. Her other arm\n Would wave the fork around just above\n The surface of the plate, casting about\n For the least possible morsel, the tiniest\n Grain of unseasoned rice. She'd dip\n Into the food like one of those shoddy\n Metal claws poised over a valley of rubber\n Bouncing balls, the kind that lifts nothing\n Or next to nothing and drops it in the chute.\n The narrow untouched hips.

Perhaps, if they hit\n The magic decibel, the whole building\n Will lift-off, and we'll ride to glory\n Like Elijah. If this is it--if this is what\n Their cries are cocked toward--let the sky\n Pass from blue, to red, to molten gold,\n To black. Let the heaven we inherit approach.\n\n  Whether it is our dead in Old Testament robes,\n Or a door opening onto the roiling infinity of space.\n Whether it will bend down to greet us like a father,\n Or swallow us like a furnace. I'm ready\n To meet what refuses to let us keep anything\n For long. What teases us with blessings,\n Bends us with grief. Wizard, thief, the great\n Wind rushing to knock our mirrors to the floor,\n To sweep our short lives clean. How mean\n\n Our racket seems beside it. My stereo on shuffle.\n The neighbor chopping onions through a wall.\n All of it just a hiccough against what may never\n Come for us.

Though\n \n Maybe it's more like life below the sea: silent,\n \n  \n \n Buoyant, bizarrely benign. Relics\n \n Of an outmoded design. Some like to imagine\n \n A cosmic mother watching through a spray of stars,\n \n  \n \n Mouthing yes, yes as we toddle toward the light,\n \n Biting her lip if we teeter at some ledge. Longing\n \n To sweep us to her breast, she hopes for the best\n \n  \n \n While the father storms through adjacent rooms\n \n Ranting with the force of Kingdom Come,\n \n Not caring anymore what might snap us in its jaw.\n \n  \n \n Sometimes,  what I see is a library in a rural community.\n \n All the tall shelves in the big open room. And the pencils\n \n In a cup at Circulation, gnawed on by the entire population.\n \n  \n \n The books have lived here all along, belonging\n \n For weeks at a time to one or another in the brief sequence\n \n Of family names, speaking (at night mostly) to a face,\n \n  \n \n A pair of eyes.

He stands until I gesture,\n \n Then he sits. Birds commence their evening chatter. Someone fires\n \n  \n \n Charcoals out below. He'll take a whiskey if I have it. Water if I don't.\n \n I ask him to start from the beginning, but he goes only halfway back.\nThat was the future once, he says. Before the world went upside down.\n \n \n Hero, survivor, God's right hand man, I know he sees the blank\n \n Surface of the moon where I see a language built from brick and bone.\n \n He sits straight in his seat, takes a long, slow high-thespian breath,\n \n  \n \n Then lets it go. For all I know, I was the last true man on this earth. And:\nMay I smoke? The voices outside soften. Planes jet past heading off or back.\n \n Someone cries that she does not want to go to bed. Footsteps overhead.\n \n  \n \n A fountain in the neighbor's yard babbles to itself, and the night air\n \n Lifts the sound indoors. It was another time, he says, picking up again.\nWe were pioneers. Will you fight to stay alive here, riding the earth\n \nToward God-knows-where?

On the ground, we tied postcards to balloons\n \n For peace. Prince Charles married Lady Di. Rock Hudson died.\n \n  \n \n We learned new words for things. The decade changed.\n \n  \n \n The first few pictures came back blurred, and I felt ashamed\n \n For all the cheerful engineers, my father and his tribe. The second time,\n \n The optics jibed.

swingings\n To look as busy bodily\n As the philosopher's brain was\n As Giovanni Bapini importuned mobs\n From monumental gums\n To the sparky detritus\n From the hurried cigarette\n Of his disciple\n Whose papa and mama kept a trattoria\n Audaciously squatting right opposite the Pitti Palace\n The Pitti Palace however stolid      could hardly help noticing\n Being an aristocrat it went

distance\n Giovanni watching the munchers supporting his parents\n With an eye\n On assuring himself\n Of their sufficient impression\n By erudition\n\n He was so young\n That explains so much\n No book ever explained what to be young is\n But they look so much more important for that\n Giovanni was in continuous ecstacy\n Induced by the imposing look of them\n When Giovanni Bapini spoke of them\n He could not tell\n How completely more precious\n Would be such knowledge\n As how many toes the philosopher Giovanni Bapini had\n\n Now the threewomen\n For pity's sake\n Let us think of her as she    to save time\n Seeing the minor Giovanni\n Sitting at the major Giovanni's feet\n Made sure he must be counting his toes\n All to the contrary    he was picking the philosopher's brains\n Happy in the security that when he had done\n He would still be youthful enough to sort out his own\n\n He listened at the elder's lips\n That taught him of earthquakes and\n Of women--\n His manners were abominable\n He would kill a woman\n Quite inconspicuously it is true\n And neglect to attend her funeral\n I mean the older man\n And what he told\n Giovanni Franchi\n About these pernicious

himself\n Yet she uniquely was the one\n To speculate      upon the number of his toes\n The days growing longer\n Fulfilling her of curiousity\n\n She made a moth's net\n Of metaphor and miracles\n And on the incandescent breath of civilizations\n She chased by moon-and-morn light\n Philosopher's toes\n\n As virginal      as had he never worn them\n Clear of 'white marks means money'\n All

winked it at her\n That he was there\n His eyes were intrepid with phantom secrets\n The Philosopher had flung to him\n And as she tripped by him\n She guessed      these all\n All    but the number of those toes\n\n She made diurnal pilgrimage\n To the trattoria\n To eat\n Trout    that might have been trained for circuses\n If minarets    grew in miniature whirlpools\n And mayonnaise       that helped her to forget\n That what is underneath       need never matter\n\n She put all minor riddles out of her\n Such as\n What was the under-cover of Franchi's book\n Telling to the plaid pattern of the tablecloth\n Too shy to interrogate\n She sent ambassadors\n To the disciple\n They returned\n Oh rats\n Quite manifest    that Giovanni Franchi\n Some semieffigy\n Damned by scholiums\n Knew no

Could we remain quiet on earth\n\n and bear it, the war we make inside\n what is--it's a long time to be here, to be still,\n\n to feel the rot inside now--bone-scrap, char, sheets of stars\n at the edge of a field where we are once again\n\n taken from ourselves.

        "Half Omen Half Hope": "When everything finally has been wrecked and further shipwrecked,\n When their most ardent dream has been made hollow and unrecognizable,\n They will feel inside their limbs the missing shade of blue that lingers\n Against hills in the cooler hours before dark, and the moss at the foot of the forest\n When green starts to leave it. What they take into their privacy (half of his embrace,\n Her violence at play) are shadows of acts which have no farewells in them.\n Moons unearth them. And when, in their separate dwellings, their bodies\n Feel the next season come, they no longer have anyone to whom\n To tell it. Clouds of reverie pass outside the window and a strange emptiness\n Peers back in. If they love, it is solely to be adored, it is to scatter and gather\n Themselves like hard seeds in a field made fallow by a fire someone years ago set.\n In the quiet woods, from the highest trees, there is always something\n Weightless falling; and he, who must realize that certain losses are irreparable,\n Tells himself at night, before the darkest mirror, that vision keeps him whole.\n\n On the verge of warm and simple sleep they tell themselves certain loves\n Are like sheets of dark water, or ice forests, or husks of ships. To stop a thing\n Such as this would be to halve a sound that travels out from a silent person's\n Thoughts. The imprint they make on each other's bodies is worth any pain\n They may have caused. Quiet falls around them. And when she reaches\n For him the air greens like underwater light and the well-waters drop.\n They will see again the shadows of insects.\n They will touch the bark and feel each age of the tree fly undisturbed\n Into them. If what is no longer present in them cannot be restored,\n It can at least be offered. Through long bewildered dusks, stalks grow;\n Rains fill and pass out of clouds; animals hover at the edges of fields\n With eyes like black pools. For nothing cannot be transformed;\n Pleasure and failure feed each other daily. Do not think any breeze,\n Any grain of light, shall be withheld. All the stars will sail out for them.",

Some books\n should stay formal on the shelves.\n So surely I heard you, in your complication aware,\n snow holding where it might weightless rest,\n and should you fold into me--trackless, misspent,\n too much arranged--I might believe you\n but swiftly shut, lines of smoke rising through snow,\n here where it seems no good word emerges.\n Though it is cold, I am aware such reluctance\n could lose these blinking hours to simple safety.\n Here is an inwardless purpose.\n In these hours when snow shuts, it may be we empty,\n amounting to something.

The islands that once dotted the bays\n have sunk, disappearing into silverish grit, thinned\n into algae and filament now being made\n quiet by plumes. Despite ourselves\n we are made quiet. The death of the sea\n a thing we must lower ourselves into\n to imagine. I will stay with you here\n inside the sheen of orange that quickly kills,\n not like the saltwater slowly starving the freshwater-\n marshes and grasses that knit this green-wet\n world together. The two breathless gannets\n found covered in oil are not unlike you,\n at the mercy of a mercy that moves in plumes,\n that insists certain fates remain\n invisible. What existed before the oil arrived\n was delicate and mired, a broom of moonlight\n swept through half-choked waves. I trust you\n if you wish for what it, too, might have been.\n  \n  \n\n\n LEADING INTO THE BAY are soft green expanses of\n grasses, saltwater channels, slicks\n not glimpsed here before.\n The birds bathe where they can,\n in half-damp shadows that make possible the next free\n climb into air. There is nothing beyond our means to feel it--\n oil pushing up to the surface where the surface-dwellers die,\n turtles pulling in from the Gulf for nesting.\n If I close my eyes I can hear the faint blue\n traces of blood over-gathered by oil\n and the sound of ice near the seafloor.\n  \n There will be a time when nothing living moves,\n a degradation of stillness beyond any liquid scar.\n Still, the solutions of despair are weak\n if you believe you can touch an undersea reef,\n the belly of a small wounded whale.\n You have the power to feel it.\n The breath of the animal\n moving like trust into your arms.\n  \n\n\n  \n BEFORE THE HOUR WHEN THE COAST slid into ocean\n we thought we saw a patch of sun greening in waves.\n The slip of a fish. There was a need\n so deep in our bodies we could not even weep.\n We called for an end and that end\n did not come. Power after power, our machine tools\n and cutting tools did nothing to hold back the brown clouds\n rippling in chaotic columns toward the light.\n And what the skies mean, passing over beds of tarred\n seaweed, feels unutterable, like the darkness\n around a candle. Where had we hoped to live?\n You came into the month with dreams.\n You walked on those beaches even though\n you knew they were sick. The bird that sought\n the reeds to die in, the fish gill-soaked with oils--\n you gathered them into yourself as if you alone\n could bring back their flickering.\n And overhead the novae exploded toward you\n along tracks of gas and dust, and the fields of ocean\n rose into you, and the crabs broke from their cancer fossils\n in masses of tiny flowers and you felt inside you\n the islands re-arise, flushed from the thickening\n imbalance of the earth.

        "Toward what island-home am I moving": "Toward what island-home am I moving,not wanting to marry, not wanting too much of that emptiness at evening, as when I walked through a field at duskand felt wide in the night.And it was again the evening that drew meback to the field where I was most alone,compassed by stems and ruts, no light of the fixed stars, no flashing in the eyes, only heather pared by dry air, shedding a small feathered radiance when I looked away,an expanse whose deep sleep seemed an unending warren I had been given, to carry out such tasks--that I might find nothing dead.  And it was again the evening that drew meback to the field where I could sense no boundary--the smell of dry earth, cool arch of my neck, the darkness entirely within myself.  And when I shut my eyes there was no one.Only weeds in drifts of stillness, only stalks and gliding sky.Come, black anchor, let us not be harmed.The deer leafing in the dark.The old man at the table, unable to remember.The children whose hunger is just hunger, and never desire."

We've seen this before--in a film, the man disappearing\n as he stands right there, his body stolid.\n  \n Let's say this man worked as an Assistant Principal and admired his own IQ.\n Let's say this man had a brutish body but was not a brute.

Has the world tilted so that language and bodily gestures are disproportionately\n discordant?\n  \n The demon called you and said, \"Is this the son I hate?\" The demon called the\n police and said the doormat in front of the door has shifted. The demon called and said,\n they are coming up from the floor, boring through and will take me. The demon locked the\n nursing assistants in the room so they couldn't get out.  The demon said someone was\n giving him arsenic. The demon hid his key, his phone, his TV remote control. The demon took\n his sleep throughout the night.\n  \n This is not the way you'd like a man to rethink his masculinity. This is not a classic film.\n The disappearing doesn't equate to some great morality. It doesn't end with a finishing\n shine. There's a moose he said, there's a moose over there, and we look in the corner\n where the sun pokes through.\n  \n Something about my brain says art and then cringes because translation is obscure.\n Because a demon is unknown.

But the language the man speaks is poetry--\n reams of syllables severing and re-joining, rivers of sounds unhinged.\n  \n Snowy strings of sentences, databases malfunctioning.

We read you book and I just loved it.\n We also read Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. There\n was no competition there. I liked your book a whole lot better.\n  \n It was an easy read. But poetry is not my favorite type\n of literature. Sometimes I am offered drinks and guys\n try to talk to me but I too just brush it off and keep dancing.\n Every once and a while the creepy mean guys try to offer you\n  \n things and then they say something. What would you do?\n Lastly, I was wondering if you ever wrote a poem that really\n didn't have a deeper meaning but everyone still tried\n to give it one anyways? Walt Whitman is better than you.",
        "Are All the Break-Ups in Your Poems Real?": "If by real you mean as real as a shark tooth stuck\n in your heel, the wetness of a finished lollipop stick,\n the surprise of a thumbtack in your purse--\n then Yes, every last page is true, every nuance,\n bit, and bite. Wait. I have made them up--all of them--\n and when I say I am married, it means I married\nall of them, a whole neighborhood of past loves.\n Can you imagine the number of bouquets, how many\n slices of cake? Even now, my husbands plan a great meal\n for us--one chops up some parsley, one stirs a bubbling pot\n on the stove. One changes the baby, and one sleeps\n in a fat chair. One flips through the newspaper, another\n whistles while he shaves in the shower, and every single\n one of them wonders what time I am coming home.",
        "The Rolling Saint": "Lotan Baba, a holy man from India, rolled on his side for\n            four thousand kilometers across the country in his quest for\n            world peace and eternal salvation.                                                     \n                                                                --Reuters \n\n\n\nHe started small: fasting here and there,\n days, then weeks. Once, he stood under\n a banyan tree for a full seven years, sitting\n             for nothing--not even to sleep. It came\n             to him in a dream: You must roll\n            on this earth, spin your heart in rain,\n                        desert, dust. At sunrise he'd stretch, swab\n                         any cuts from the day before, and lay prone\n                         on the road while his twelve men swept\n             the ground in front of him with sisal brooms.\n             Even monkeys stopped and stared at this man\n             rolling through puddles, past storefronts\n where children would throw him pieces\n of butter candy he'd try and catch\n in his mouth at each rotation. His men\n             swept and sang, swept and sang\n             of jasmine-throated angels\n             and pineapple slices in kulfi cream.\n                         He rolled and rolled. Sometimes\n                         in his dizzying spins, he thought\n                         he heard God. A whisper, but still.",
        "What I Learned From the Incredible Hulk": "When it comes to clothes, make\n an allowance for the unexpected.\n Be sure the spare in the trunk\n of your station wagon with wood paneling\n  \n isn't in need of repair. A simple jean jacket\n says Hey, if you aren't trying to smuggle\nrare Incan coins through this peaceful\nlittle town and kidnap the local orphan,\n  \nI can be one heck of a mellow kinda guy.\n But no matter how angry a man gets, a smile\n and a soft stroke on his bicep can work\n wonders. I learned that male chests\n  \nalso have nipples, warm and established--\n green doesn't always mean envy.\n It's the meadows full of clover\n and chicory the Hulk seeks for rest, a return\n \n to normal. And sometimes, a woman\n gets to go with him, her tiny hands\n correcting his rumpled hair, the cuts\n in his hand. Green is the space between\n \n water and sun, cover for a quiet man,\n each rib shuttling drops of liquid light.",
        "Red Ghazal": "I've noticed after a few sips of tea, the tip of her tongue, thin and red\n with heat, quickens when she describes her cuts and bruises--deep violets and red.\n  \n The little girl I baby-sit, hair orange and wild, sits splayed and upside down\n on a couch, insists her giant book of dinosaurs is the only one she'll ever read.\n  \n The night before I left him, I could not sleep, my eyes fixed on the freckles\n of his shoulder, the glow of the clock, my chest heavy with dread.\n  \n Scientists say they'll force a rabbit to a bird, a jellyfish with a snake, even\n though the pairs clearly do not mix. Some things are not meant to be bred.\n  \n I almost forgot the weight of a man sitting beside me in bed sheets crumpled\n around our waists, both of us with magazines, laughing at the thing he just read.\n  \n He was so charming--pointed out planets, ghost galaxies, an ellipsis\n of ants on the wall. And when he kissed me goodnight, my neck reddened.\n  \n I'm terrible at cards. Friends huddle in for Euchre, Hearts--beg me to play\n with them. When it's obvious I can clearly win with a black card, I select a red.\n  \n I throw away my half-finished letters to him in my tiny pink wastebasket, but\n my aim is no good. The floor is scattered with fire hazards, declarations unread.",
        "After the Auction, I Bid You Good-Bye": "You elbow me with your corduroy jacket\n when a box chock-full of antique marbles comes up.\n I can't hear your whispers above the auctioneer's racket.\n  \n The clipped speech of the auctioneer cracked\n me up when you impersonated him in bed. Like a wild, thick mop\n I soak up every copper smell from your corduroy jacket.\n  \n In two days, I will drive you to the airport, packed\n with other couples pressed tightly at the top\n of the escalator. Lines sear my cheek from your corduroy jacket\n  \n when we hug--then a quick kiss good-bye tacked\n on at the end. I'll finger the rim on the paper coffee cup\n you leave in my car. When I hear your name I can't forget\n  \n how your long torso pressed against my bare back,\n bluish in this early light. Your fingers shot into me, popped\n my spine into a wicked arch. There is no lack\n  \n of how it haunts me still--what I bid--lost, sacked\n and wrapped for other girls. I should have looked up\n to see who else was bidding, but I studied the folds in your jacket.\n My limit is spent, loud and certain as the auctioneer's racket.",
        "First Anniversary, With Monkeys": "Periyar Nature Preserve\n\n\n\n\n There is no crumbly frozen cake to thaw.\n Today, we are in the jungle. I mean mosquito. I mean\n  \n tigers and elephants sludging their way\n to the lake for a drink and Don't make sudden moves\n  \n or snakes startled from an afternoon nap\n will greet you fang first. I think we are lost. Too hot\n  \n for any cold confection to survive. Even my tube\n of sunblock is as warm as a baby's bottle. You get\n  \n to those places I can't reach, those places I dared\n not even whisper before I walked down the aisle\n  \n in white. You never worried if our families\n would clash, if they would clang like the clutch\n  \n of pale monkeys clanging the thin branches of the treetrops,\n begging for our trail mix. You never worried\n  \n about my relatives staring at your pale, muscled calves--\n things not usually seen outside of the bedroom. You wore\n  \n hiking shorts anyway. And still, they lavished ladle-fuls\n of food on your plate. I think we are lost. My eyes are dark\n  \n and wet as that wild deer that walked right past us,\n a little off the trail. I think we are lost, but for once\n  \n I don't mind. Eventually you turn us back to a place\n not on any map, but I know I can trace it back with my finger\n  \n if we ever need it again.

        "Invitation": "Come in, come in. The water's fine! You can't get lost\n here. Even if you want to hide behind a clutch\n            of spiny oysters -- I'll find you. If you ever leave me\n            at night, by boat, you'll see the arrangement\n\n of red-gold sun stars in a sea of milk. And though\n it's tempting to visit them -- stay. I've been trained\n           to gaze up all my life, no matter the rumble\n           on earth, but I learned it's okay to glance down\n\n into the sea. So many lessons bubble up if you know\n where to look. Clouds of plankton churning\n            in open whale mouths might send you east\n            and chewy urchins will slide you west.

If you dive\n             deep enough where imperial volutes and hatchetfish\n             swim, you will find all the colors humans have not yet\n\n named, and wide caves of black coral and clamshell.\n A giant squid finally let itself be captured\n            in a photograph, and the paper nautilus ripple-flashes\n            scarlet and two kinds of violet when it silvers you near.\n\n Who knows what will happen next?

        "The Cry of the Children": "\"Pheu pheu, ti prosderkesthe m ommasin, tekna;\" [[Alas, alas, why do you gaze at me with your eyes, my children.]]--Medea.\n\n\n\nDo ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers,       Ere the sorrow comes with years ? They are leaning their young heads against their mothers, --       And that cannot stop their tears. The young lambs are bleating in the meadows ;    The young birds are chirping in the nest ; The young fawns are playing with the shadows ;    The young flowers are blowing toward the west-- But the young, young children, O my brothers,       They are weeping bitterly ! They are weeping in the playtime of the others,       In the country of the free.  Do you question the young children in the sorrow,       Why their tears are falling so ? The old man may weep for his to-morrow       Which is lost in Long Ago -- The old tree is leafless in the forest --    The old year is ending in the frost -- The old wound, if stricken, is the sorest --    The old hope is hardest to be lost : But the young, young children, O my brothers,       Do you ask them why they stand Weeping sore before the bosoms of their mothers,       In our happy Fatherland ?  They look up with their pale and sunken faces,       And their looks are sad to see, For the man's grief abhorrent, draws and presses       Down the cheeks of infancy -- \"Your old earth,\" they say, \"is very dreary;\"    \"Our young feet,\" they say, \"are very weak !\" Few paces have we taken, yet are weary--    Our grave-rest is very far to seek ! Ask the old why they weep, and not the children,       For the outside earth is cold -- And we young ones stand without, in our bewildering,       And the graves are for the old !\"  \"True,\" say the children, \"it may happen       That we die before our time ! Little Alice died last year her grave is shapen       Like a snowball, in the rime. We looked into the pit prepared to take her --    Was no room for any work in the close clay : From the sleep wherein she lieth none will wake her,    Crying, 'Get up, little Alice ! it is day.' If you listen by that grave, in sun and shower,    With your ear down, little Alice never cries ; Could we see her face, be sure we should not know her,    For the smile has time for growing in her eyes ,-- And merry go her moments, lulled and stilled in       The shroud, by the kirk-chime ! It is good when it happens,\" say the children,       \"That we die before our time !\"  Alas, the wretched children ! they are seeking       Death in life, as best to have ! They are binding up their hearts away from breaking,       With a cerement from the grave. Go out, children, from the mine and from the city --    Sing out, children, as the little thrushes do -- Pluck you handfuls of the meadow-cowslips pretty    Laugh aloud, to feel your fingers let them through ! But they answer, \" Are your cowslips of the meadows       Like our weeds anear the mine ? Leave us quiet in the dark of the coal-shadows,       From your pleasures fair and fine!  \"For oh,\" say the children, \"we are weary,       And we cannot run or leap -- If we cared for any meadows, it were merely       To drop down in them and sleep. Our knees tremble sorely in the stooping --    We fall upon our faces, trying to go ; And, underneath our heavy eyelids drooping,    The reddest flower would look as pale as snow. For, all day, we drag our burden tiring,       Through the coal-dark, underground -- Or, all day, we drive the wheels of iron       In the factories, round and round.  \"For all day, the wheels are droning, turning, --       Their wind comes in our faces, -- Till our hearts turn, -- our heads, with pulses burning,       And the walls turn in their places Turns the sky in the high window blank and reeling --    Turns the long light that droppeth down the wall, -- Turn the black flies that crawl along the ceiling --    All are turning, all the day, and we with all ! -- And all day, the iron wheels are droning ;       And sometimes we could pray, 'O ye wheels,' (breaking out in a mad moaning)       'Stop ! be silent for to-day ! ' \"  Ay ! be silent ! Let them hear each other breathing       For a moment, mouth to mouth -- Let them touch each other's hands, in a fresh wreathing       Of their tender human youth ! Let them feel that this cold metallic motion    Is not all the life God fashions or reveals -- Let them prove their inward souls against the notion    That they live in you, or under you, O wheels ! -- Still, all day, the iron wheels go onward,       As if Fate in each were stark ; And the children's souls, which God is calling sunward,       Spin on blindly in the dark.  Now tell the poor young children, O my brothers,       To look up to Him and pray -- So the blessed One, who blesseth all the others,       Will bless them another day. They answer, \" Who is God that He should hear us,    While the rushing of the iron wheels is stirred ? When we sob aloud, the human creatures near us    Pass by, hearing not, or answer not a word ! And we hear not (for the wheels in their resounding)       Strangers speaking at the door : Is it likely God, with angels singing round Him,       Hears our weeping any more ?  \" Two words, indeed, of praying we remember ;       And at midnight's hour of harm, -- 'Our Father,' looking upward in the chamber,       We say softly for a charm. We know no other words, except 'Our Father,'    And we think that, in some pause of angels' song, God may pluck them with the silence sweet to gather,    And hold both within His right hand which is strong. 'Our Father !' If He heard us, He would surely       (For they call Him good and mild) Answer, smiling down the steep world very purely,       'Come and rest with me, my child.'  \"But, no !\" say the children, weeping faster,       \" He is speechless as a stone ; And they tell us, of His image is the master       Who commands us to work on. Go to ! \" say the children,--\"up in Heaven,    Dark, wheel-like, turning clouds are all we find ! Do not mock us ; grief has made us unbelieving --    We look up for God, but tears have made us blind.\" Do ye hear the children weeping and disproving,       O my brothers, what ye preach ? For God's possible is taught by His world's loving --       And the children doubt of each.  And well may the children weep before you ;       They are weary ere they run ; They have never seen the sunshine, nor the glory       Which is brighter than the sun : They know the grief of man, without its wisdom ;    They sink in the despair, without its calm -- Are slaves, without the liberty in Christdom, --    Are martyrs, by the pang without the palm, -- Are worn, as if with age, yet unretrievingly       No dear remembrance keep,-- Are orphans of the earthly love and heavenly :       Let them weep ! let them weep !  They look up, with their pale and sunken faces,       And their look is dread to see, For they think you see their angels in their places,       With eyes meant for Deity ;-- \"How long,\" they say, \"how long, O cruel nation,    Will you stand, to move the world, on a child's heart, -- Stifle down with a mailed heel its palpitation,    And tread onward to your throne amid the mart ? Our blood splashes upward, O our tyrants,       And your purple shews your path ; But the child's sob curseth deeper in the silence       Than the strong man in his wrath !\"",
        "Grief": "I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless;  That only men incredulous of despair,  Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air  Beat upward to God's throne in loud access  Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness,  In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare  Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare  Of the absolute heavens. Deep-hearted man, express  Grief for thy dead in silence like to death--  Most like a monumental statue set  In everlasting watch and moveless woe  Till itself crumble to the dust beneath.  Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet:  If it could weep, it could arise and go.",

If thy foot in scorn Could tread them out to darkness utterly, It might be well perhaps. But if instead Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow The grey dust up,... those laurels on thine head, O My beloved, will not shield thee so, That none of all the fires shall scorch and shred The hair beneath.

The second passed in height The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed, Half falling on the hair. O beyond meed! That was the chrism of love, which love's own crown, With sanctifying sweetness, did precede. The third, upon my lips, was folded down In perfect, purple state! since when, indeed, I have been proud and said, \"My Love, my own.\"",

        "A Musical Instrument": "I. WHAT was he doing, the great god Pan,     Down in the reeds by the river ? Spreading ruin and scattering ban, Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat, And breaking the golden lilies afloat     With the dragon-fly on the river.  II. He tore out a reed, the great god Pan,     From the deep cool bed of the river : The limpid water turbidly ran, And the broken lilies a-dying lay, And the dragon-fly had fled away,     Ere he brought it out of the river.  III. High on the shore sate the great god Pan,     While turbidly flowed the river ; And hacked and hewed as a great god can, With his hard bleak steel at the patient reed, Till there was not a sign of a leaf indeed     To prove it fresh from the river.  IV. He cut it short, did the great god Pan,     (How tall it stood in the river !) Then drew the pith, like the heart of a man, Steadily from the outside ring, And notched the poor dry empty thing     In holes, as he sate by the river.  V.  This is the way,' laughed the great god Pan,     Laughed while he sate by the river,)  The only way, since gods began To make sweet music, they could succeed.' Then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed,     He blew in power by the river.  VI. Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan !     Piercing sweet by the river ! Blinding sweet, O great god Pan ! The sun on the hill forgot to die, And the lilies revived, and the dragon-fly     Came back to dream on the river.  VII. Yet half a beast is the great god Pan,     To laugh as he sits by the river, Making a poet out of a man : The true gods sigh for the cost and pain, -- For the reed which grows nevermore again     As a reed with the reeds in the river.",

Straightway I was 'ware, So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair, And a voice said in mastery, while I strove, ... Guess now who holds thee?'--Death,' I said. But there, The silver answer rang ... Not Death, but Love.'",

The cup of dole God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink, And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear.

Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change? That's hardest. If to conquer love, has tried, To conquer grief, tries more ... as all things prove; For grief indeed is love and grief beside. Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love. Yet love me--wilt thou?

I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of being and ideal grace. I love thee to the level of every day's Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. I love thee freely, as men strive for right; I love thee purely, as they turn from praise. I love thee with the passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death.Poetry Out Loud Note: In the print anthology, this poem is titled simply \"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\" The student may give either title during their recitation."

        "How to Draw a Perfect Circle": "I can imitate the spheres of the model's body, her head,Her mouth, the chin she rests at the bend of her elbowBut nothing tells me how to make the pupils spiralFrom her gaze. Everything the eye sees enters a circle,The world is connected to a circle: breath spools from the nostrilsAnd any love to be open becomes an O. The shape inside the circleIs a circle, the egg fallen outside the nest the serpent circlesRests in the serpent's gaze the way my gaze rests on the model.In a blind contour drawing the eye tracks the subjectWithout observing what the hand is doing. Everything is connectedBy a line curling and canceling itself like the shape of a snakeSwallowing its own decadent tail or a mind that means to destroy itself,A man circling a railway underpass before attacking a policeman.To draw the model's nipples I have to let myself be carried away.I love all the parts of the body. There are as many curvesAs there are jewels of matrimony, as many whirls as there are teethIn the mouth of the future: the mute pearls a bride wears to her \nwedding,The sleeping ovaries like the heads of riders bunched in a tunnel.The doors of the subway car imitate an O opening and closing,In the blood the O spirals its helix of defects, genetic shadows,But there are no instructions for identifying loved ones who go crazy.When one morning a black man stabs a black transit cop in the faceAnd the cop, bleeding from his eye, kills the assailant, no one travelingTo the subway sees it quickly enough to make a camera phone \nwitness.The scene must be carried on the tongue, it must be carriedOn the news into the future where it will distract the eyes workingLines into paper. This is what blind contour drawing conjures in me.At the center of God looms an O, the devil believes justice is shapedLike a zero, a militant helmet or war drum, a fist or gun barrel,A barrel of ruined eggs or skulls. To lift anything from a fieldThe lifter bends like a broken O. The weight of the bodyLowered into a hole can make anyone say Oh: the onlookers,The mother, the brothers and sisters. Omen begins with an O.When I looked into my past I saw the boy I had not seen in yearsDo a standing backflip so daring the onlookers called him crazy.I did not see a moon as white as an onion but I saw a paper plateUpon which the boy held a plastic knife and sopping meat.An assailant is a man with history. His mother strugglesTo cut an onion preparing a meal to be served after the funeral.The onion is the best symbol of the O. Sliced, a volatile gas stingsThe slicer's eyes like a punishment clouding them until they seeWhat someone trapped beneath a lid of water sees:A soft-edged world, a blur of blooms holding a coffin afloat.The onion is pungent, its scent infects the air with sadness,All the pallbearers smell it. The mourners watch each other,They watch the pastor's ambivalence, they wait for the doors to open,They wait for the appearance of the wounded one-eyed victimAnd his advocates, strangers who do not consider the assailant's funeralAppeasement. Before that day the officer had never fired his gunIn the line of duty. He was chatting with a cabdriverBeneath the tracks when my cousin circled him holding a knife.The wound caused no brain damage though his eyeball was severed.I am not sure how a man with no eye weeps. In the OdysseyPink water descends the Cyclops's cratered face after OdysseusDrives a burning log into it. Anyone could do it. Anyone couldBegin the day with his eyes and end it blind or deceased,Anyone could lose his mind or his vision. When I go crazyI am afraid I will walk the streets naked, I am afraid I will shoutEvery fucked up thing that troubles or enchants me, I will try to murderOr make love to everybody before the police handcuff or murder me.Though the bullet exits a perfect hole it does not leave perfect holesIn the body. A wound is a cell and portal. Without it the blood runsWith no outlet. It is possible to draw handcuffs using loopsShaped like the symbol for infinity, from the Latin infinitasMeaning unboundedness. The way you get to anythingIs context. In a blind contour it is not possible to give your subjectA disconnected gaze. Separated from the hand the artist's eyeBegins its own journey. It could have been the same for the Cyclops,A giant whose gouged eye socket was so large a whole onionCould fit into it. Separated from the body the eye beginsIts own journey. The world comes full circle: the hours, the harvests,When the part of the body that holds the soul is finally decomposedIt becomes a circle, a hole that holds everything: blemish, cell,Womb, parts of the body no one can see. I watched the modelPull a button loose on her jeans and step out of themAs one might out of a hole in a blue valley, a sea. I found myselfIn the dark, I found myself entering her body like a delicate shellOr soft pill, like this curved thumb of mine against her lips.You must look without looking to make the perfect circle.The line, the mind must be a blind continuous liquidUntil the drawing is complete.",

        "Ode to Big Trend": "Pretty soon the Negroes were looking to get paid. My partner, Big Trend, wiped his ox neck and said  He wasn't going to wait too much longer. You Know that look your daddy gets before he whups you?  That's how Big Trend looked. There was a pink scar Meddling his forehead. Most people assumed a bear  Like him couldn't read anything but a dollar, But I'd watched him tour the used bookstore In town and seen him napping so I knew he held more  Than power in those hands. They could tear A Bible in two. Sometimes on the walk home I'd hear  Him reciting poems. But come Friday, he was the one The fellas asked to speak to the boss. He'd go alone,  Usually, and left behind, we imagined the boss buckled Into Trend's shadow because our money always followed.",
        "Stick Elegy": "The dead were still singing Turn the lights down low Beneath Yellow Bridge where years before, clowning And ass out, Stick jumped with nothing but the State Championship trophy in his righteous clutch.

        "Mystic Bounce": "Even if you love the racket of ascension, you must know how the power leaves you. And at this pitch who has time for meditation? the sea walled in by buildings. I do miss the quiet, don't you? When I said, \"Fuck the deer antlered and hithered in fur,\" it was because I had seen the faces of presidents balled into a fist. If I were in charge, I would know how to fix the world: free health care or free physicals, at least, and an abiding love for the abstract. When I said, \"All of history is saved for us,\" it was because I scorned the emancipated sky. Does the anthem choke you up? When I asked God if anyone born to slaves would die a slave, He said: \"Sure as a rock descending a hillside.\" That's why I'm not a Christian."

Supine, its belly swells with salt and figs with meat and treaties, it corks open a profound song-- itself it sings into books heavy with truths on the chair dressed with leather and raw hides kissed by ox blood smeared with beef dung lined with raw silk woven from worms plucked from boughs basted across its pious beaming eyes its spidery ghosted lids, and its byzantine glance unmoors from its Chinese porcelain and crosses the ebony table polished with lac secreted from the cloaca of the kerria lacca set with glazed cakes eaten by pinked mouths wearing crimson robes, to its guests polished and glossed and stained by the ooze drawn to color the uncolored raw linen, the wood, the human.

        "J is for Jarasandha": "There once lived a great king whose twin wives could bear him no children. A wandering sage saw the king's grief and offered him a magical mango. She who ate the mango would be with child. As he had two wives, the king cut the mango into two perfect halves and offered one half to each wife. After nine months, each wife gave birth to one lifeless half. Horrified, the king ordered these clots of flesh to be left in the forest. A wandering demon found the two lifeless halves and cupped one in each palm. When she brought them together, the two halves fused and a whole child was made in front of her eyes--the demon named the child Jarasandha.\n\nYears passed by and this child grew to be an intimidating and invincible warrior. In a fight with Bhim, an equally invincible warrior, Jarasandha was ripped in half by his enemy. But, each time he was ripped apart, his halves found a way to meet up and become whole. Krishna, who witnessed how Jarasandha's flesh found its own way back to flesh, motioned to his own cousin with his fingers: toss the halves of his body in opposite directions, he\nsuggested.\n\nSo, when Bhim ripped Jarasandha apart once again, he swung his left half to the right side of the arena and his right half to the left. And his body found no way to return to itself.\n\nIn the Toronto airport, where I've arrived for a conference, I watch an older Punjabi lady--made to sit in a wheelchair behind two lines of customs officials, a security guard, a translator, and a service-staff member--scream that her son is outside the airport may she please just go tell him she is here she is here she is here please. I stand there holding her hand, my own luggage reluctantly traveling in loops on the belt. Beta--child-- she says to me: please tell them my son is here and I am here what is the problem let me go let me go to him.",
        "M is for Michael Jackson and Malcolm X": "In the epilogue to The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Alex Haley recounts meeting a pensive Malcolm at the Kennedy airport, watching newly immigrated children \"romping and playing\" in their sudden home. \"By tomorrow night,\" Malcolm says to Alex, \"they'll know how to say their first English word--nigger.\"\n\n Before cable television arrived in India, America was a white nation. I imagined New England snows dusting California and Miami's beaches stretched across Appalachia. America was a papier-mache parody patched together by a cheaply hired prop maker. Geographic accuracy was sacrificed to the interpersonal dramas of Betty and Veronica, and the American banquet was limited to the malted and fried offerings in Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe, where the Riverdale gang solved the real geopolitical problems of how to get Reggie off Moose's back with the help of Archie's fumbling charms. Here, class warfare came with a side of fries. There were rumors of distant family members \"settling\" in \"North Dakota\" or \"Oklahoma\"--names that put themselves together like Lego castles: hard-edged and jutting out with an abrupt L or a particularly pokey K.\n\n Blackness was just a rumor too. Blackness flickered in the background of photographs they sent back from these mysterious locations: here's an uncle waving at us from a glittering Times Square (Los Angeles); here's an aunt waving at us mid-way through the soft-focus neon breakfasts with Aunt Jemima's maple syrup (made from maple leaves); here's a nephew waving at us next to the poster of a red and white Michael Jordan in a quilted bedroom, his rotund brown body snuggled in tie-dye and tucked into tartan flannel sheets. Blackness was a rumor, that is, until Michael Jackson's Bad ripped into our consciousness and suddenly, knobby-kneed pre-teens found a way to make stringy curls with coconut oil stolen from their mothers' kitchens and started moonwalking backwards into my Social Studies classrooms, all snappy crotch and jaunty limbs. We girls rolled our eyes but we kept on watching.\n\n It wasn't long before Jackson's unsparing gaze, draped in slick black leather, began replacing the glowing pastel Ganeshes and Saraswatis hanging above study desks. But replacing an elephantine god's soft paunch with lean, mean celebrity did not save us from our own ignorance of how blackness and brownness were connected through a struggle for economic self-realization and human rights. While kids in Chennai were rehearsing Michael Peters' signature choreography for \"Thriller\" and pretending to be zombies--little exemplary half-dead spectacles--Union Carbide was industriously shirking responsibility for the Bhopal Tragedy, which choked thousands of Indians to death, and black mortality was spiking in violent, homicidal protest of the US DEA's drug buys and cocaine busts.\n\n In other words, Tamilians blinked away Michael Jackson's blackness. We kept the heat and thunder of his fat synth bass, which found its way into Ilayaraaja's electric disco in films of the late 1980s like Vetri Vizha and Agni Natchathiram. We kept the ebullient automation of his moves, which became a muscular theme in Prabhu Deva's blend of baggy breakdance and whimsical terukoothu folk dancing in the 1990s. But we forgot his blackness. In time, the lightning of his presence was replaced by the grey hum of CNN, Cops, Law & Order, and the dull horror of handcuffs on dark wrists. Posters yellowed, cassettes spooled out, and my moonwalking classmates found their scientific calculators and study guides again.\n\n But the rumors of racial difference in George Bush Sr.'s America continued to bloom and wilt in morose cycles in my childhood homes into the 1990s. In damp clusters, it grew like moss under rocks. Rootless, it stretched its stringy arms and held us by the ankles; it grew like mold between bathroom tiles; it spun itself fine and strong, webbing into corners where our brooms couldn't reach. In time, the mossy rocks lined our after-dinner walks past the hibiscus bushes. In time, a grandmother slipped on the bathroom tiles and stayed in bed, fed conjee by a fatherless girl brought in from the village and the moss grew between her toes and drew her into the earth where they buried the nameless pets and tossed the chicken feathers. In time, the spiders hung so low they fell into pickle jars every time a child fished for a gooseberry or a slice of stony green mango from the brine. And from this brine, in time, we learned to believe that it existed. And as Tamilian families began drifting from the flashy monsoons of India to the June gloom of the California bay or to the sharp wet summers of the Keys, they carried the damp and stench in suitcases and buried it in hushed conversations. They made a poultice of moss and spider web and lodged it in the prayer books, hung it around the children's necks like a talisman, and they said--as long as she doesn't marry a black man."

Some look wobbly, cocked\n at oddball angles or slumping forlornly\n on precariously listing posts. One box\n bows steeply forward, as if in disgrace, its door\n lolling sideways, unhinged. Others are dented,\n battered, streaked with rust, bandaged in duct tape,\n crisscrossed with clothesline or bungee cords.\n A few lie abashed in remnants of the very snow\n that knocked them from their perches.\n Another is wedged in the crook of a tree\n like a birdhouse, its post shattered nearby.\n I almost feel sorry for them, worn out\n by the long winter, off-kilter, not knowing\n what hit them, trying to hold themselves\n together, as they wait for news from spring.",
        "Visitation": "Walking past the open window, she is surprised by the song of the white-throated sparrow and stops to listen. She has been thinking of the dead ones she loves--her father who lived over a century, and her oldest son, suddenly gone at forty-seven--and she can't help thinking she has called them back, that they are calling her in the voices of these birds passing through Ohio on their spring migration. . . because, after years of summers in upstate New York, the white-throat has become something like the family bird. Her father used to stop whatever he was doing and point out its clear, whistling song. She hears it again: \"Poor Sam Peabody Peabody Peabody.\" She tries not to think, \"Poor Andy,\" but she has already thought it, and now she is weeping. But then she hears another, so clear, it's as if the bird were in the room with her, or in her head, telling her that everything will be all right. She cannot see them from her second-story window-- they are hidden in the new leaves of the old maple, or behind the white blossoms of the dogwood-- but she stands and listens, knowing they will stay for only a few days before moving on."

bullaces,\nRare pears and greengages,\nDamsons and bilberries,\nTaste them and try:\nCurrants and gooseberries,\nBright-fire-like barberries,\nFigs to fill your mouth,\nCitrons from the South,\nSweet to tongue and sound to eye;\nCome buy, come buy.\"\n\n          Evening by evening\nAmong the brookside rushes,\nLaura bow'd her head to hear,\nLizzie veil'd her blushes:\nCrouching close together\nIn the cooling weather,\nWith clasping arms and cautioning lips,\nWith tingling cheeks and finger tips.\n\"Lie close,\" Laura said,\nPricking up her golden head:\n\"We must not look at goblin men,\nWe must not buy their fruits:\nWho knows upon what soil they fed\nTheir hungry thirsty roots?\"\n\"Come buy,\" call the goblins\nHobbling down the glen.\n\n\"Oh,\" cried Lizzie, \"Laura, Laura,\nYou should not peep at goblin men.\"\nLizzie cover'd up her eyes,\nCover'd close lest they should look;\nLaura rear'd her glossy head,\nAnd whisper'd like the restless brook:\n\"Look, Lizzie, look, Lizzie,\nDown the glen tramp little men.\nOne hauls a basket,\nOne bears a plate,\nOne lugs a golden dish\nOf many pounds weight.\nHow fair the vine must grow\nWhose grapes are so luscious;\nHow warm the wind must blow\nThrough those fruit bushes.\"\n\"No,\" said Lizzie, \"No, no, no;\nTheir offers should not charm us,\nTheir evil gifts would harm us.\"\nShe thrust a dimpled finger\nIn each ear, shut eyes and ran:\nCurious Laura chose to linger\nWondering at each merchant man.\nOne had a cat's face,\nOne whisk'd a tail,\nOne tramp'd at a rat's pace,\nOne crawl'd like a snail,\nOne like a wombat prowl'd obtuse and furry,\nOne like a ratel tumbled hurry skurry.\nShe heard a voice like voice of doves\nCooing all together:\nThey sounded kind and full of loves\nIn the pleasant weather.\n\n          Laura stretch'd her gleaming neck\nLike a rush-imbedded swan,\nLike a lily from the beck,\nLike a moonlit poplar branch,\nLike a vessel at the launch\nWhen its last restraint is gone.\n\n          Backwards up the mossy glen\nTurn'd and troop'd the goblin men,\nWith their shrill repeated cry,\n\"Come buy, come buy.\"\nWhen they reach'd where Laura was\nThey stood stock still upon the moss,\nLeering at each other,\nBrother with queer brother;\nSignalling each other,\nBrother with sly brother.\nOne set his basket down,\nOne rear'd his plate;\nOne began to weave a crown\nOf tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts brown\n(Men sell not such in any town);\nOne heav'd the golden weight\nOf dish and fruit to offer her:\n\"Come buy, come buy,\" was still their cry.\nLaura stared but did not stir,\nLong'd but had no money:\nThe whisk-tail'd merchant bade her taste\nIn tones as smooth as honey,\nThe cat-faced purr'd,\nThe rat-faced spoke a word\nOf welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard;\nOne parrot-voiced and jolly\nCried \"Pretty Goblin\" still for \"Pretty Polly;\"--\nOne whistled like a bird.\n\n          But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste:\n\"Good folk, I have no coin;\nTo take were to purloin:\nI have no copper in my purse,\nI have no silver either,\nAnd all my gold is on the furze\nThat shakes in windy weather\nAbove the rusty heather.\"\n\"You have much gold upon your head,\"\nThey answer'd all together:\n\"Buy from us with a golden curl.\"\nShe clipp'd a precious golden lock,\nShe dropp'd a tear more rare than pearl,\nThen suck'd their fruit globes fair or red:\nSweeter than honey from the rock,\nStronger than man-rejoicing wine,\nClearer than water flow'd that juice;\nShe never tasted such before,\nHow should it cloy with length of use?\nShe suck'd and suck'd and suck'd the more\nFruits which that unknown orchard bore;\nShe suck'd until her lips were sore;\nThen flung the emptied rinds away\nBut gather'd up one kernel stone,\nAnd knew not was it night or day\nAs she turn'd home alone.\n\n          Lizzie met her at the gate\nFull of wise upbraidings:\n\"Dear, you should not stay so late,\nTwilight is not good for maidens;\nShould not loiter in the glen\nIn the haunts of goblin men.\nDo you not remember Jeanie,\nHow she met them in the moonlight,\nTook their gifts both choice and many,\nAte their fruits and wore their flowers\nPluck'd from bowers\nWhere summer ripens at all hours?\nBut ever in the noonlight\nShe pined and pined away;\nSought them by night and day,\nFound them no more, but dwindled and grew grey;\nThen fell with the first snow,\nWhile to this day no grass will grow\nWhere she lies low:\nI planted daisies there a year ago\nThat never blow.\nYou should not loiter so.\"\n\"Nay, hush,\" said Laura:\n\"Nay, hush, my sister:\nI ate and ate my fill,\nYet my mouth waters still;\nTo-morrow night I will\nBuy more;\" and kiss'd her:\n\"Have done with sorrow;\nI'll bring you plums to-morrow\nFresh on their mother twigs,\nCherries worth getting;\nYou cannot think what figs\nMy teeth have met in,\nWhat melons icy-cold\nPiled on a dish of gold\nToo huge for me to hold,\nWhat peaches with a velvet nap,\nPellucid grapes without one seed:\nOdorous indeed must be the mead\nWhereon they grow, and pure the wave they drink\nWith lilies at the brink,\nAnd sugar-sweet their sap.\"\n\n          Golden head by golden head,\nLike two pigeons in one nest\nFolded in each other's wings,\nThey lay down in their curtain'd bed:\nLike two blossoms on one stem,\nLike two flakes of new-fall'n snow,\nLike two wands of ivory\nTipp'd with gold for awful kings.\nMoon and stars gaz'd in at them,\nWind sang to them lullaby,\nLumbering owls forbore to fly,\nNot a bat flapp'd to and fro\nRound their rest:\nCheek to cheek and breast to breast\nLock'd together in one nest.\n\n          Early in the morning\nWhen the first cock crow'd his warning,\nNeat like bees, as sweet and busy,\nLaura rose with Lizzie:\nFetch'd in honey, milk'd the cows,\nAir'd and set to rights the house,\nKneaded cakes of whitest wheat,\nCakes for dainty mouths to eat,\nNext churn'd butter, whipp'd up cream,\nFed their poultry, sat and sew'd;\nTalk'd as modest maidens should:\nLizzie with an open heart,\nLaura in an absent dream,\nOne content, one sick in part;\nOne warbling for the mere bright day's delight,\nOne longing for the night.\n\n          At length slow evening came:\nThey went with pitchers to the reedy brook;\nLizzie most placid in her look,\nLaura most like a leaping flame.\nThey drew the gurgling water from its deep;\nLizzie pluck'd purple and rich golden flags,\nThen turning homeward said: \"The sunset flushes\nThose furthest loftiest crags;\nCome, Laura, not another maiden lags.\nNo wilful squirrel wags,\nThe beasts and birds are fast asleep.\"\nBut Laura loiter'd still among the rushes\nAnd said the bank was steep.\n\n          And said the hour was early still\nThe dew not fall'n, the wind not chill;\nListening ever, but not catching\nThe customary cry,\n\"Come buy, come buy,\"\nWith its iterated jingle\nOf sugar-baited words:\nNot for all her watching\nOnce discerning even one goblin\nRacing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling;\nLet alone the herds\nThat used to tramp along the glen,\nIn groups or single,\nOf brisk fruit-merchant men.\n\n          Till Lizzie urged, \"O Laura, come;\nI hear the fruit-call but I dare not look:\nYou should not loiter longer at this brook:\nCome with me home.\nThe stars rise, the moon bends her arc,\nEach glowworm winks her spark,\nLet us get home before the night grows dark:\nFor clouds may gather\nThough this is summer weather,\nPut out the lights and drench us through;\nThen if we lost our way what should we do?\"\n\n          Laura turn'd cold as stone\nTo find her sister heard that cry alone,\nThat goblin cry,\n\"Come buy our fruits, come buy.\"\nMust she then buy no more such dainty fruit?\nMust she no more such succous pasture find,\nGone deaf and blind?\nHer tree of life droop'd from the root:\nShe said not one word in her heart's sore ache;\nBut peering thro' the dimness, nought discerning,\nTrudg'd home, her pitcher dripping all the way;\nSo crept to bed, and lay\nSilent till Lizzie slept;\nThen sat up in a passionate yearning,\nAnd gnash'd her teeth for baulk'd desire, and wept\nAs if her heart would break.\n\n          Day after day, night after night,\nLaura kept watch in vain\nIn sullen silence of exceeding pain.\nShe never caught again the goblin cry:\n\"Come buy, come buy;\"--\nShe never spied the goblin men\nHawking their fruits along the glen:\nBut when the noon wax'd bright\nHer hair grew thin and grey;\nShe dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn\nTo swift decay and burn\nHer fire away.\n\n          One day remembering her kernel-stone\nShe set it by a wall that faced the south;\nDew'd it with tears, hoped for a root,\nWatch'd for a waxing shoot,\nBut there came none;\nIt never saw the sun,\nIt never felt the trickling moisture run:\nWhile with sunk eyes and faded mouth\nShe dream'd of melons, as a traveller sees\nFalse waves in desert drouth\nWith shade of leaf-crown'd trees,\nAnd burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.\n\n          She no more swept the house,\nTended the fowls or cows,\nFetch'd honey, kneaded cakes of wheat,\nBrought water from the brook:\nBut sat down listless in the chimney-nook\nAnd would not eat.\n\n          Tender Lizzie could not bear\nTo watch her sister's cankerous care\nYet not to share.\nShe night and morning\nCaught the goblins' cry:\n\"Come buy our orchard fruits,\nCome buy, come buy;\"--\nBeside the brook, along the glen,\nShe heard the tramp of goblin men,\nThe yoke and stir\nPoor Laura could not hear;\nLong'd to buy fruit to comfort her,\nBut fear'd to pay too dear.\nShe thought of Jeanie in her grave,\nWho should have been a bride;\nBut who for joys brides hope to have\nFell sick and died\nIn her gay prime,\nIn earliest winter time\nWith the first glazing rime,\nWith the first snow-fall of crisp winter time.\n\n          Till Laura dwindling\nSeem'd knocking at Death's door:\nThen Lizzie weigh'd no more\nBetter and worse;\nBut put a silver penny in her purse,\nKiss'd Laura, cross'd the heath with clumps of furze\nAt twilight, halted by the brook:\nAnd for the first time in her life\nBegan to listen and look.\n\n          Laugh'd every goblin\nWhen they spied her peeping:\nCame towards her hobbling,\nFlying, running, leaping,\nPuffing and blowing,\nChuckling, clapping, crowing,\nClucking and gobbling,\nMopping and mowing,\nFull of airs and graces,\nPulling wry faces,\nDemure grimaces,\nCat-like and rat-like,\nRatel- and wombat-like,\nSnail-paced in a hurry,\nParrot-voiced and whistler,\nHelter skelter, hurry skurry,\nChattering like magpies,\nFluttering like pigeons,\nGliding like fishes,--\nHugg'd her and kiss'd her:\nSqueez'd and caress'd her:\nStretch'd up their dishes,\nPanniers, and plates:\n\"Look at our apples\nRusset and dun,\nBob at our cherries,\nBite at our peaches,\nCitrons and dates,\nGrapes for the asking,\nPears red with basking\nOut in the sun,\nPlums on their twigs;\nPluck them and suck them,\nPomegranates, figs.\"--\n\n          \"Good folk,\" said Lizzie,\nMindful of Jeanie:\n\"Give me much and many: --\nHeld out her apron,\nToss'd them her penny.\n\"Nay, take a seat with us,\nHonour and eat with us,\"\nThey answer'd grinning:\n\"Our feast is but beginning.\nNight yet is early,\nWarm and dew-pearly,\nWakeful and starry:\nSuch fruits as these\nNo man can carry:\nHalf their bloom would fly,\nHalf their dew would dry,\nHalf their flavour would pass by.\nSit down and feast with us,\nBe welcome guest with us,\nCheer you and rest with us.\"--\n\"Thank you,\" said Lizzie: \"But one waits\nAt home alone for me:\nSo without further parleying,\nIf you will not sell me any\nOf your fruits though much and many,\nGive me back my silver penny\nI toss'd you for a fee.\"--\nThey began to scratch their pates,\nNo longer wagging, purring,\nBut visibly demurring,\nGrunting and snarling.\nOne call'd her proud,\nCross-grain'd, uncivil;\nTheir tones wax'd loud,\nTheir looks were evil.\nLashing their tails\nThey trod and hustled her,\nElbow'd and jostled her,\nClaw'd with their nails,\nBarking, mewing, hissing, mocking,\nTore her gown and soil'd her stocking,\nTwitch'd her hair out by the roots,\nStamp'd upon her tender feet,\nHeld her hands and squeez'd their fruits\nAgainst her mouth to make her eat.\n\n          White and golden Lizzie stood,\nLike a lily in a flood,--\nLike a rock of blue-vein'd stone\nLash'd by tides obstreperously,--\nLike a beacon left alone\nIn a hoary roaring sea,\nSending up a golden fire,--\nLike a fruit-crown'd orange-tree\nWhite with blossoms honey-sweet\nSore beset by wasp and bee,--\nLike a royal virgin town\nTopp'd with gilded dome and spire\nClose beleaguer'd by a fleet\nMad to tug her standard down.\n\n          One may lead a horse to water,\nTwenty cannot make him drink.\nThough the goblins cuff'd and caught her,\nCoax'd and fought her,\nBullied and besought her,\nScratch'd her, pinch'd her black as ink,\nKick'd and knock'd her,\nMaul'd and mock'd her,\nLizzie utter'd not a word;\nWould not open lip from lip\nLest they should cram a mouthful in:\nBut laugh'd in heart to feel the drip\nOf juice that syrupp'd all her face,\nAnd lodg'd in dimples of her chin,\nAnd streak'd her neck which quaked like curd.\nAt last the evil people,\nWorn out by her resistance,\nFlung back her penny, kick'd their fruit\nAlong whichever road they took,\nNot leaving root or stone or shoot;\nSome writh'd into the ground,\nSome div'd into the brook\nWith ring and ripple,\nSome scudded on the gale without a sound,\nSome vanish'd in the distance.\n\n          In a smart, ache, tingle,\nLizzie went her way;\nKnew not was it night or day;\nSprang up the bank, tore thro' the furze,\nThreaded copse and dingle,\nAnd heard her penny jingle\nBouncing in her purse,--\nIts bounce was music to her ear.\nShe ran and ran\nAs if she fear'd some goblin man\nDogg'd her with gibe or curse\nOr something worse:\nBut not one goblin scurried after,\nNor was she prick'd by fear;\nThe kind heart made her windy-paced\nThat urged her home quite out of breath with haste\nAnd inward laughter.\n\n          She cried, \"Laura,\" up the garden,\n\"Did you miss me?\nCome and kiss me.\nNever mind my bruises,\nHug me, kiss me, suck my juices\nSqueez'd from goblin fruits for you,\nGoblin pulp and goblin dew.\nEat me, drink me, love me;\nLaura, make much of me;\nFor your sake I have braved the glen\nAnd had to do with goblin merchant men.\"\n\n          Laura started from her chair,\nFlung her arms up in the air,\nClutch'd her hair:\n\"Lizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted\nFor my sake the fruit forbidden?\nMust your light like mine be hidden,\nYour young life like mine be wasted,\nUndone in mine undoing,\nAnd ruin'd in my ruin,\nThirsty, canker'd, goblin-ridden?\"--\nShe clung about her sister,\nKiss'd and kiss'd and kiss'd her:\nTears once again\nRefresh'd her shrunken eyes,\nDropping like rain\nAfter long sultry drouth;\nShaking with aguish fear, and pain,\nShe kiss'd and kiss'd her with a hungry mouth.\n\n          Her lips began to scorch,\nThat juice was wormwood to her tongue,\nShe loath'd the feast:\nWrithing as one possess'd she leap'd and sung,\nRent all her robe, and wrung\nHer hands in lamentable haste,\nAnd beat her breast.\nHer locks stream'd like the torch\nBorne by a racer at full speed,\nOr like the mane of horses in their flight,\nOr like an eagle when she stems the light\nStraight toward the sun,\nOr like a caged thing freed,\nOr like a flying flag when armies run.\n\n          Swift fire spread through her veins, knock'd at her heart,\nMet the fire smouldering there\nAnd overbore its lesser flame;\nShe gorged on bitterness without a name:\nAh! fool, to choose such part\nOf soul-consuming care!\nSense fail'd in the mortal strife:\nLike the watch-tower of a town\nWhich an earthquake shatters down,\nLike a lightning-stricken mast,\nLike a wind-uprooted tree\nSpun about,\nLike a foam-topp'd waterspout\nCast down headlong in the sea,\nShe fell at last;\nPleasure past and anguish past,\nIs it death or is it life?\n\n          Life out of death.\nThat night long Lizzie watch'd by her,\nCounted her pulse's flagging stir,\nFelt for her breath,\nHeld water to her lips, and cool'd her face\nWith tears and fanning leaves:\nBut when the first birds chirp'd about their eaves,\nAnd early reapers plodded to the place\nOf golden sheaves,\nAnd dew-wet grass\nBow'd in the morning winds so brisk to pass,\nAnd new buds with new day\nOpen'd of cup-like lilies on the stream,\nLaura awoke as from a dream,\nLaugh'd in the innocent old way,\nHugg'd Lizzie but not twice or thrice;\nHer gleaming locks show'd not one thread of grey,\nHer breath was sweet as May\nAnd light danced in her eyes.\n\n          Days, weeks, months, years\nAfterwards, when both were wives\nWith children of their own;\nTheir mother-hearts beset with fears,\nTheir lives bound up in tender lives;\nLaura would call the little ones\nAnd tell them of her early prime,\nThose pleasant days long gone\nOf not-returning time:\nWould talk about the haunted glen,\nThe wicked, quaint fruit-merchant men,\nTheir fruits like honey to the throat\nBut poison in the blood;\n(Men sell not such in any town):\nWould tell them how her sister stood\nIn deadly peril to do her good,\nAnd win the fiery antidote:\nThen joining hands to little hands\nWould bid them cling together,\n\"For there is no friend

I wasn't even mad.\n I was the lucky egg, trained for gratitude\n inside the belly for nine months straight.\n Two workers welded bunk beds at the end\n of the delivery room. One on top of the other.\n My universe might have been the white lime ceiling,\n or the embodiment of Einstein's bent space\n in the aluminum springs of the bed above\n that curved toward the center.\n\n Neither cold, nor warm.\n \"It was a clear day,\" my mother told me.\n\n It's hard to believe\n there were a few romantic evenings\n when I was conceived, a buzz in the retina\n and red-laced magma\n decadently peeling off\n a silver candlestick.\n Infants' cries and milk fever\n turned to salt from the stench of bleach--\n abrasive, unequivocal.\n With a piece of cloth wrapped on the end of a stick,\n the janitor casually extends the negative space\n of the black-and-white tiled floor\n like a mouth of broken teeth, a baleen of darkness\n sieving out new human destinies.\n  \n  \n 2.\n 1968. At the dock, ships arriving from the East\n dumped punctured rice bags, mice\n and the delirium of the Cultural Revolution.\n A couple of men in uniform\n cleared out the church\n in the middle of the night.\n The locals saw the priest in the yard\n wearing only his underwear, shivering from the cold.\n Their eyes, disillusioned, questioned one another:\n \"Wasn't he the one who pardoned our sins?\"\n  \n Icons burned in front of their eyes,\n icons and the holy scriptures.\n Witnesses stepped farther back,\n as if looking at love letters\n nobody dared to claim.\n  \n Crosses were plucked from graves. And from each mouth\n spilled irreversible promises:\n mounds of dirt the rains would smooth down\n sooner or later.\n  \n Children dragged church bells by the tongue.\n (Why didn't they think of this before?)\n Overnight, the dome was demolished, instantly revealing\n a myriad of nameless stars that chased the crowd\n like flies on a dead horse.\n  \n And what could replace Sunday mass now?\n Women brought cauldrons into the yard.\n Men filled up their pipes; smoke rose\n into the air, against gravity's pull.\n Nails in worn out shoes exposed stigmata\n that bled in the wrong places--\n a new code of sanctification,\n of man, by man.\n  \n  \n 3.\n \"Read!\"--I was told. Who said that?\n Angel Gabriel, or my first-grade teacher\n who had dark roots underneath her bleached curls?\n  \n Language arrived fragmentary\n split in syllables, spasmodic\n like code in times of war.\n  \n \"Continue where your classmate left off!\"\n A long sentence tied us to one another\n without connotation as if inside an idiom.\n Someone would get to read the noun, another the verb,\n a third one a pronoun. . .\n I always got the exclamation mark at the end--\n a mere grimace, a small curse.\n  \n A tall cast-iron stove below the portrait of the dictator,\n puffing smoke from its temples, enough heat for everyone.\n On the blackboard,    \n leftover diphthongs from yesterday or the day before\n rubbed against one another like kittens.\n  \n After dusk, I looked for another language outside the window,\n my eyes glued to a constellation\n (they call these types \"dreamers\")\n my discovery possibly a journey into the past,\n toward a galaxy already dead, nonexistent,\n the kind of news that needs millions of years\n to reach me.\n  \n \"Read!\"--the angel shook me for a third time\n her finger pointing to an arbitrary word\n a million light years apart from its object. (It didn't matter who\n        was first).\n Negative space sketched my onomatopoeic profile\n of body and shadow in an accidental encounter.\n  \n  \n 4.\n Language is erosive.\n It makes us recluses,\n a wind through the canyons\n carving our paleontological eras\n for everyone to read.\n  \n Under the revised testament of my skin\n bellows a gold-cast bull, an alluring object,\n a need for attention.\n Then comes the unleavened bread and a last supper,\n which, remarkably, is repeated several times\n between ice ages.\n Lower yet, Sodom.\n I recognize it from the stench of sulfur.\n  \n I hold my nose. Freud would have done the same.\n And then Cain,\n a crow taught him how to bury his own brother. . .\n And at the bottom,\n Adam's gentlemanlike sin\n under which scientists\n discover earlier epochs of famine.\n  \n Between unidentified layers,\n wanderings in the sand, the search for a new prophet. . .\n  \n I try to understand my people.\n Their language is plain. Some words,\n were actually never uttered, like pages stuck together\n in a book fresh off the press\n and long after it sits on a shelf.\n  \n This, too, lives inside me\n within insidious bubbles of air, negative\n spaces where I can find little historical rest,\n but also where utter ruin may originate.\n  \n\n 5.\n Little left of the snow three days ago.\n Its blanket ripped away, exposing\n dog shit and the bruises of routine.\n  \n Negative space gives form to the woods\n and to the mad woman--a silhouette\n of the goddess Athena\n wearing a pair of flip flops,\n an owl on her shoulder.\n  \n It's minus zero. The factory's gate gnashes its teeth\n behind the back of the last worker. Blowing noses, shivering,\n      mucus. . .\n A virus circulates through the workplace,\n secretly, intimately touching one person after another,\n a current of sensuality.\n It softens the tone.\n\n But nothing unites them more than their frailty,\n The one-sizes-fits-all shoes you must grow accustomed to\n By filling the extra space with cotton,\n Or curling your ill-fitting toes.\n  \n\n 6.\n In Halil's yard,\n rules were sacrilege.\n His eight children entertained themselves\n by carrying famine on their shoulders,\n recalling St. Bartholomew's flayed skin.\n Starving, filthy, hazel-eyed--\n three qualities that unexpectedly coalesce\n in the bright light, strung together like sneezes.\n  \n One's famine was another's consolation.\n \"Look at them! It's a sin for us to complain.\n They're even worse off than us!\"\n But even Halil found his own consolation\n in the old woman Zyra, \"barren and paralyzed,\"\n the root origin of despair.\n  \n This was our highlands landscape,\n hierarchical, where each family\n would make out a different expiration date\n on the roof below their own.\n  \nSchadenfreude was the only river\n that could turn mills.\n  \n But if this hierarchy shifted,\n and our roof gave signs of ruin,\n my mother would plant tulips in the garden,\n white tulips, our false image,\n a scarecrow to keep predators away.\n  \n  \n 7.\n Nearly nothing was mentioned in the letters he sent from prison,\n just two lines, on top of the page:\n \"I am well. . .\" and \"If you can,\n please send me a pair of woolen socks.\"\n  \n From them, I learned to read between the lines:\n negative spaces, the unsaid, gestures,\n insomnia that like a hat's shadow\n fails to shade your chin and ears.\n  \n And in the photographs' white background,\n acrophobia adds to the color of their eyes: blue,\n green, gray, and ultimately, chesnut brown,\n as, earthward, we lower our gaze.\n  \n I learned to read the empty spaces the dead left\n behind--a pair of folded glasses\n after the reading's done and discourse commences.\n  \n Or the musical chairs game called \"love,\"\n where there are less empty seats than people.\n If you don't want to be the last one standing\n you must predict when the music will stop.\n (Who, though, has really succeeded?)\n  \n Perhaps a little practice can be useful in this case.\n I don't mean squatting, jumping, stretching,\n but listening to the same music every day from the start,\n the same miserable vinyl record\n so that you'll recognize its cracks\n before it recognizes yours.\n  \n  \n 8.\n Midnight. Snoring,\n meaningless sounds that stain the side of the wall\n that belongs to no one.\n So where are we? What dimension?\n Who foots the bill at a time like this\n without lambs or sinners,\n when even angels record nothing?\n  \n The street's clearly visible\n under the neon 24-hour-service sign\n above the funeral home.\n There was a music shop next to it\n that closed down a few months ago;\n the shop shared a wall with the funeral home,\n shared the same water pipes and the same gate to heaven.\n But the coffins won,\n the wide-shouldered coffins that narrow down\n in the shape of a mummy, not a human.\n Wood of the highest quality, swears the owner,\n and pure silk inside, pleated like a stomach\n that can digest even a bulldozer.\n  \n When asleep we're simply five limbs. Starfish.\n If you cut one limb, it will grow back.\n Even a single limb could recreate us from the beginning,\n      a single hope.\n Negative space is always fertile.\n  \n  \n 9.\n No one knows if it was simply a matter of mixed\n or some other reason why I used to see\n what I wasn't supposed to see--\n the ending of things.\n It wasn't a mystical gift, but like a blood clot\n in the darkness of a vein, I held on to reason,\n as it circulated from the bottom up\n and not the other way around as we were told.\n I used to start from the edges\n and with my left hand or a croupier's stick\n gather the balls and dice from the corners\n and then watch the bettors\n as neither a winner nor a loser.\n There's nothing sillier\n than watching a film in reverse\n where after the climax, the protagonists\n are replaced by circumstances,\n and circumstances replaced by minor characters,\n their tongues plastered behind a single, fatal smirk\n Life and my short lunar calendar slipped away\n like carbon paper sending off as much light as necessary,\n skipping the details, the contrast and sharp colors.\n Lunar time is short. Until the actual end,\n there are years enough, the negative spaces.\n What to do with them when the verb\n has already been uttered, a conclusive sentence\n with Latin syntax, or more than that:\n didactic.",

The ship stuck in ice.\n       Endurance. \n Ships are women. They prefer soft seas.\n In the best-case scenario, she's called La Santa Maria \n and she throws you, like Columbus, on some foreign shore.\n  \n But if you get too close to her. . .\n  \n The very day after\n we washed her deck with warm water and soap,\n warmed her arteries with gin,\n stroked her lower back with our surrogate songs,\n shaved our beards and exposed the illiterate lines on our faces,\n she took off.\n  \n And from the shore,\n we saw how she broke her ribs, sinking,\n aft first, so fast we didn't even have time to pray,\n leaving behind her ash-tree fragrance\n and faux pearls on the water.\n  \n \"Such a woman!\" someone laughed bitterly,\n \"She knows when to leave so as not to be forgotten.\"\n  \n\n 3.\n A woman, naturally, has no business there.\n Antarctica is a masculine continent--\n male penguins keep the eggs warm,\n the moon stands up on the street to urinate\n after being kicked out of the tavern,\n the cold like a cut-throat razor, dulled for three thousand years,\n and the sled dogs, the Huskies,\n we kill with a single bullet\n so they won't starve to death. In this way\n we instill a little character into the new land\n before the arrival of Conquistadors, thieves,\n assassins, missionaries, prostitutes,\n the first invading army of every continent.\n  \n Antarctica is a man's continent,\n because only a man chooses to break into the darkness of the mind\n by conquering the body,\n as Amundsen and Scott did, their glory\n reaching to the apex of ecstasy.\n Zero degree of geographical latitude,\n utter collapse.\n\n  \n 4.\n Hunger is overestimated. The stomach functions much like the\n      brain:\n when it has nothing to think about, it feeds off memories.\n It can last three days just thinking of a single biscuit.\n But those who have a better memory, meaning a much stronger\n      acidity,\n can go on for months\n remembering a slice of prosciutto, two fried eggs,\n sweetly folding their eyelids like napkins after a meal.\n  \n Then hallucinations begin. Banquets. Easter supper.\n Feet move impatiently under the table;\n the scent of rosemary wafts from a platter\n and two clean serving hands with burns here and there.\n That's when you feel grief-stricken\n and you attack the seals and penguins with your\n alpine knives and shoes like a madman\n in an empty amphitheater.\n Or is this, too, a hallucination,\n and in this case not ours\n but Antarctica's?\n  \n And when clarity finally returns,\n both stomach and brain\n notice only their own deep wrinkles.\n  \n  \n 5.\n Blubber, blubber, seal's blubber.\n Blubber that keeps your spirits alive, rendering it for fuel, for light,\n blubber to mask the body's foul odor,\n --a mixture of doubt, hope, and ammonia.\n And if you have nothing better to do,\n think of a cow's thigh hanging at the butcher's,\n its delicate streak of fat\n like a silk ribbon.\n  \n I survived even this sarcasm.\n  \n And every night, before bed,\n we read recipes to each other\n one of a few things we secretly rescued\n from the ship before she sank,\n as if these items were her lingerie.\n  \n What a show it was!\n What pathos in pronouncing prosciutto, sugar, omelet!\n What sensuality in milk, parsley, cinnamon!\n We made these words up ourselves.\n Nothing exists until its moment of absence.\n  \n But first, in order to warm up our mouths\n like actors before going on stage,\n we'd repeat mechanically, palates dry,\n \"Bless us, O Lord,\n and this food we've received through your mercy.\"\n  \n  \n 6.\n It was the Romans who spoiled the word\n studying rhetoric\n before anatomy and mathematics:\nVir bonus dicendi peritus\n \"The good man skilled in speaking\" (Marcus Porcius Cato)\n  \n But in Antarctica, words are measured differently: by calories!\n With a simple greeting you lose five calories,\n just as many to keep a fire burning for a full minute.\n And a Ciceronian argument can consume a whole day's\n       nutrition;\n think carefully before you open your mouth.\n  \n The word is overestimated.\n  \n Sometimes it's enough to avert your eyes from your shoes\n to imply \"gangrene\";\n and a vague exchange of glances between men\n is enough to understand that the ice is cracking beneath your feet\n and death is closer than your fingers.\n  \n\n 7.\n Stretched smooth from end to end--such is Antarctica. In fact,\n even a baby's skin looks withered by comparison.  \n No emotions. No regrets. No warnings.\n Either fight or die.\n  \n My father was like this more or less. A teacher at a village school.\n In classrooms that smelled of sheep-wool pullovers\n drying on the body. And eyes that moved freely\n in their hollows, like toes\n inside an older sibling's shoes.\n  \n Unlike the Romans,\n my father preached about justice and honor\n his hands folded behind his back.\n His shoulders seemed twice as wide\n as his worn jacket.\n  \n I inherited his sharp, gray gaze\n and his soft voice.\n Eyes that say \"Go\" and a voice that says \"Stay.\"\n You never know which one to trust.\n  \n  \n 8.\n And mother? Oh, she was simply Captain Cook's niece,\n --the great James Cook--\n from morning to night\n when she washed, swept, dug potatoes from the garden,\n fixed her husband's tie on Sundays\n even from her bed, while in labor.\n She never spoke of this. As it wasn't necessary.\n People speak of what they have, not what they are.\n  \n She was a tailor. Measured everyone's perimeter with a glance;\n erred only on the width of one's neck, an unknown strength.\n Her large scissors followed\n the white chalk line on the cloth so precisely. \"Snip!\"\n She said little. Her silence followed the white outlines\n of another tailor,\n over a fabric much older than she was.\n  \n But now that I think of it,\n how did the poor woman respond to her friends asking,\n \"Where is your son?\"\n \"He's exploring the world.\"\n \"And what does he bring back from there?\"\n \"Himself, alive, I hope.\"\n \"What's the point of returning empty-handed after two years?\"\n  \n Was she at least a little proud of me? Of her Frank?\n Certainly not. She was Captain Cook's niece.\n The past always conquers.\n  \n  \n 9.\n I was the first of thirteen children.\n And as a rule, each of them\n eyed one of my belongings.\n One eyed my bed near the window\n that overlooked the water where frogs lived\n and asparagus grew on the shore.\n Another eyed my green jacket bought with borrowed money,\n poker cards, a fishing net,\n my wicker chair with the damaged back.\n Another whistled my favorite tune:\n \"What Will We Do with a Drunken Sailor?\"\n without reaching the refrain.\n And yet another envied the basement\n --that place I occupied in my father's heart--\n  with its elm door hanging by a single hinge.\n  \n But the time hasn't come to leave home just yet,\n until your own brother begins to use your shaving kit\n and dreams of the same girl.\n  \n  \n 10.\n What shaving kit? Antarctica makes you grow a double-beard\n as if you were a hundred-year-old grave.\n And, while you remember wasting time waiting in line at\n       barber's\n another beard grows, a red one.\n  \n Here, each body part works for itself:\n the stomach, hands, intestines, eyes. . .\n The unity of the body is overestimated, too.\n  \n Only skin pulls everything together like a sled.\n The skin? Which skin? Man loses his first skin\n to his first love, like the snake early in spring\n on a thorn-apple bush that blocks the way.\n From that point on he stops counting the rest.\n  \n\n 11. \n I don't know why it was named \"Elephant Island,\"\n when it answered the ocean with the cries of a she-wolf.\n We could only make out her sly teats under her belly. After\n       some time,\n if she didn't kill us first, we'd begin to cry like wolves ourselves.\n  \n Twenty-two people. Packed next to one another under two\n       inverted boats\n like notes in Bach's \"Come, Sweet Death, Come Blessed Rest,\"\n with more pauses, a dramatic suffocation between breaths.\n A dry, calcic cough was a sign of life. Or the delirious mutterings\n         of someone\n dreaming aloud of \"ice\" in the middle of ice,\n after they had cut off his toes.\n  \n But the hardest moment arrives in the morning,\n when, with shut eyes and plugged nostrils,\n as if drinking your own urine\n you recycle the same lie for four months straight:\n \"Men, pack up your stuff! The boss might arrive today!\"\n  \n And they obeyed me. Packed carefully each day from the start,\n leaving nothing shap in the folds of their bags,\n nothing that would spoil the line between fact and fiction.\n  \n It was a time when\n routine grew more powerful than hope.\n  \n  \n 12.\n Fish in the ocean toyed with our citizenship.\n On the seventh mile, we left our medals behind, class ranks,\n along with the dogs, potatoes, and a camera.\n We made fire out of money\n and kept only a single metal coin each\n so that archaeologists might trace us more easily centuries later.\n On Elephant Island, we had to bid farewell even to tobacco,\n tobacco which reminded us of village alleyways\n and walks home after midnight.\n  \n Time glided above us without touching a single strand of our\n      hair--\n nonexistent, as if gliding above ancient cities,\n exposing the solemnity of our white bones\n and crickets on absent walls.\n  \n That's when the ten commandments deserted us:\n \"Do not steal,\" \"Do not lie,\" \"Do not covet,\"\n \"Honor your parents\". . .\n save one of them perhaps,\n the one about the holiness of Sunday.\n  \n We already had nothing. We belonged to no one.\n An entirely new species: HOMO ANTARCTICUS.\n A scientific proof that \"forgotten\" and \"free\"\n mean the same thing.\n  \n  \n 13.\n Two years after returning from the world of the dead,\n you find your house taken over by another tenant\n and the rent tripled,\n the commemorative plaque nailed to the gate:\n \"Here lived F.W.\"\n And your lover, or better, ex-lover,\n for the same reason,\n in the arms of another\n three times more handsome.\n  \n You see your own image sold at an auction.\n Artifact. Original. \"Brrramp. Sold!\" The price so high\n you can't afford it. But even if you could,\n you're an illegal customer,\n holding a death certificate in your hand.\n  \n And you find your parents turned into winter trees\n their eyes fixed on a large cloud of plaster.\n They don't expect visitors. Best not disturb them.\n Let their leaves fall quietly where they will\n let the crow's nest remain in the armpit of a branch,\n where it has always been.\n  \n Perhaps you should take a shortcut, start over.\n Or you know what? There's a war going on nearby, they say.\n Go there instead!\n But this time die better.\n  \n  \n 14.\n War's never satisfied with flesh;\n Fresh, branded, smoked,\n with or without blood\n blue blood, dark, thick, whatever kind.\n And frozen blood like yours\n could store at minus 40 degrees Celsius,\n viruses from 1914 unscathed,\n and the map of the old Empire         \n and Scott's hurt ego \n and old coins minted with the head of Edward VII,\n and Browning's poetry and the epic of the unknown,\n like an envelope inside an envelope,\n all making you the ideal candidate.\n  \n Back on the ship, ammunition everywhere,\n sailing through the cold Northern seas\n where you had to learn a new language.\n A new language is like a fish:\n first, you need to remove its spine\n in order to chew it.\n  \n Unlike in Antarctica,\n one's purpose in war is clear: kill or be killed,\n though sometimes it's the same difference.\n  \n Baltic nights gave you what Antarctica refused you:\n the other half of the celestial sphere.\n You meet Vera, the widow of a tea plantation owner,\n a character out of a Baroque novel, her pupils blurred with dusk,\n and the ritual of mourning fitted perfectly to her body\n like a final journey. \n  \n  \n 15.\n A man charmed by a glacier,\n who knows too well the flawless forms of her body,\n feels her eavesdropping gaze even when asleep,\n her clean and distant breath\n and her heart, a piece of ice, that melts inside a cigarette case\n heated for drinking water,\n finds it difficult to marry a real woman,\n to marry Vera.\n And Africa.\n  \n I bought land. Barren. Hundreds of acres. In Zululand.\n I didn't fare well with tobacco. Planted cotton instead,\n chose bodily peace rather than meditation.\n My nearest neighbor lived 45 miles away. White, of course.\n And my fate, never blended with the blacks,\n those beautiful statues, wrapped in straw.\n I heard them nod off during lunch break,\n like the oars of a boat,\n in complete sync.\n They knew where they were heading.\n But I didn't.\n  \n And I was right. It didn't take long\n before drought, floods, worms\n destroyed everything. The bank left me only my own beard\n and the malarial shadow of a baobab. Apart from other things,\n Vera filled out divorce papers. The woman in the yellow dress,\n yellow as quinine, yellow as the sigh of a hinge at dusk,\n the woman married to the hero\n who now can't even manage a small plot of land.\n  \n  \n 16.\n The man in front of me\n --my master I call \"Boss\"--\n is newly shaved, and dressed in a striped tie and jacket\n as if the Prince of Wales or Fred Astaire,\n a style that arrives here two years late.\n He asks me to serve whiskey to clients at the bar\n and chat them up\n using their jargon, gestures,\n sentences uninterrupted by mosquitoes,\n and the abstract rhetoric of the Depression years.\n And, to be frank,\n he pays me for the latter.\n  \n But what do I know,\n what does a survivor know about the art of living,\n for which new instincts are needed, new muscles\n and other kinds of heart valves?\n  \n Furthermore,\n how can I obey such a spick-and-span boss,\n having known the smoky gods of Antarctica\n who recognize each other solely by the nose\n and can end rebellions with a glance\n and count the deaths as members of the crew?\n How can I take orders from a boss whose name isn't Shackleton?\n  \n  \n 17.\n \"Second in command,\" \"Lieutenant,\" \"Shackleton's right hand\"\n  \n What did she see so clearly in me,\n my drama teacher in elementary school\n when she'd always assign me the role of Father Joseph,\n of Gaspar the Magi offering Jesus frankincense,\n or of John the Baptist always there to clear the path?\n What did she see in my metallic pupils, baritone voice,\n       infrequent speech\n as if scissors, bandage, and iodine\n inside a first aid kit?\n  \n Under Antarctica's naked sky, each of us followed his own star.\n Even the carpenter, his own heraldic calling.\n You didn't need much to feed them;\n  just a few crusts of insomnia and the tents' punctured holes.\n  \n My star was weak; you could hardly see it\n hidden behind another larger, troubled star\n like a calm valley that appears behind jagged peaks\n more attractive when absent.\n  \n  \n 18.\n What happened afterward can be told in a few words:\n I worked in a mine; earth's warm heart,\n happened to be crueler than her frozen brain.\n I laid railroad tracks South, always toward the Unknown.\n It was like playing only two strings on a violin: joy and sorrow,\n fatefully blending at the horizon.\n  \n I repaired houses. Another waste of time.\n I never understood their weak points,\n just as you can't make out eyes from genitals or mouth\n in some underwater creatures.\n  \n And when I was left penniless,\n I gave lectures about Antarctica,\n water gurgling in my gullet every five words, for those few\n who listened patiently to an adventure of survival.\n  \n Then Bea arrived. Or sweet Beatrice.\n It was easy to grant her what I had left in my heart\n --that set of heavy museum keys--\n with no fear she might lose them.\n  \n Tired lungs and liver\n could barely follow my split image\n of bust and bottle of booze.\n Like a prophet in the last circle of Dante's Inferno,\n I carried my own decapitated head in hand.\n  \n My ashes were lost at the base of a church. No one\n       thought of them.\n It was a time of war. Another world war. The second\n one not knowing what to do with her own ashes either.\n\n  \n 19.\n Some of us died in the war.  Others took to the sea again,\n the gray, cracked waters of the South,\n decks perspiring fuel and alcohol.\n Our random itineraries. Full-time melancholics.\n  \n For months in Antarctica,\n we waited for our shadow to return\n and consumed that question you ask yourself only once in your\n      lifetime,\n the way one consumes chickenpox.\n  \n And the rest of the time,\n we counted the scars left on our faces,\n with a gesture you could call indifferent and epic,\n or childlike."

        "We Lived": "We lived in the long intolerable called God.\n We seemed happy.\n  \n I don't mean content I mean heroin happy,\n donkey dentures,\n  \n I mean drycleaned deacons expunging suffering\n from Calcutta with the cut of their jaws\n  \n I mean the always alto and surely anusless angels\n divvying up the deviled eggs and jello salad in the after-rapture\n  \n I mean\n to be mean.\n  \n Dear Lord forgive the love I have\n for you and your fervent servants.\n  \n I have so long sojourned Lord\n among the mild ironies and tolerable gods\n  \n that what comes first to mind\n when I'm of a mind to witness\n  \n is muriatic acid\n eating through the veins\n  \n of one whose pains were so great\n she wanted only out, Lord, out.\n  \n She too worshipped you.\n She too popped her little pill of soul.\n  \n Lord if I implore you please just please leave me alone\n is that a prayer that's every instance answered?\n  \n I remember one Wednesday witness told of a time\n his smack-freaked friends lashed him\n  \n to the back of a Brahman bull that bucked and shook\n until like great bleeding wings the man's collarbones\n  \n exploded out of his skin.\n Long pause.\n  \n \"It was then,\" the man said, \"right then...\"\n Yes.

        "Being Serious": "I.\n Serious smiles a lot.\n At least that's what they say,\n His Mum and Pop\n Trying to be proud\n As all the nurses gather round\n To squint into the cloud\n Of little Serious on the ultrasound.\nIt's likely just the way he's bent,\n The head nurse finally thunders\n Into the awe and argument\n Swirling through the crowd\n Where someone mutters half-aloud\nIn all my years...\n  \n Serious never hears.\n Serious spins and spins\n With his dumb dolphin grin\n In the best bed there is,\n Where there's no guilt and no sin,\n No child more inner than this;\n Nothing to will\n And nothing to want,\n No body you both are and haunt;\n No drug of disappointment\n Or feeling that there's never now\n (Or do these seep in somehow?);\n No suffering the world's idiocy\n  \n Like a saint its pains;\n No traffic and no planes;\n No debts, no taxes,\n No phones and no faxes;\n No rockslide of information\n Called the Internet.\n  \n Serious isn't. Yet.\n  \n  \n 2.\n Serious hears a sound.\n Not unusual, in itself, nothing to be concerned about.\n Here and there there's been a shout,\n A song he seemed to be inside,\n The weird whale-calls of her gas.\n This, too, shall pass.\n  \n Then it comes again,\n And with a far-off force\n Which a shrink less serious than he\n Will have him dream is a drain\n That all his impurity\n Is slowly drifting toward\n(Down, Serious says, down!) \n Beyond which he'll be clean,\n Feel no pain...\n  \n Then the dark erupts in a rain\n Of blood and muck\n He seems to mostly be,\n Holding on for all he's worth,\n Which isn't much, finally,\n Little wizened thing\n Plopping out to an earth\n Where cries of agony\n Dwindle to equivocal joy\n(It's, it's...is it a boy?) \n And some clear world lies\n Just beyond the eyes\n You can't quite open;\n  \n And everything is wet,\n And loud, and broken;\n And all of life is one huge tit\n You're meant to somehow suck.\n  \n Serious staggers to his feet,\n Slaps himself harder than the doctor did\n And says, I'm fucked.\n  \n  \n 3.\n Serious is learning silence\n In the way most children learn to speak.\nPoshlust!\n He gasps after his first feeding,\nGotterdammerung in his first dusk,\n His whole body writhing with a kind of violence\n As if the world had wounded him,\n Words his bleeding.\n  \nAnomie, Deus absconditus\n Drift into the air above his crib;\nAccursed progenitor, quintessence of dust\n Dribble with the pap onto his bib;\n As day by day, and week by week,\n Serious wrestles with this difficult gift,\n Forgetting, which, it seems, he is on this earth to do.\n  \nBoob, ass, oaf,\n Riving out of him like greatness going off;\nNinny, crackpate, clunkhead, gorm,\n Leaving him gasping and bent;\nfragments, sheep, rabble,\n All falling, falling from him\n Backwards into babble...\n  \n Finally Serious lies there, spent,\n Language like some immense ghostly mobile\n Bobbing just above his bed,\n All power of movement gone as well:\n  \n Useless little buglike arms, buglike little fingers,\n This heavy, heavy head.\n  \n And now if there's something Serious can't quite taste,\n Or if he feels too acutely his own waste,\n Or knows too acutely what he can't tell,\n He screams and screams\n Until the world knows what Serious means.\n  \n  \n 4.\n Serious goes to school.\nJust try it, his Mum says\n As she lets go his hand\n And wipes a last glaze\n Of doughnut from his nose,\n And Serious, insofar as Serious can,\n Does give it a good try,\n Though it's hard to understand\n Why they keep taking a break\n From taking breaks, or why\n They can't simply walk\n In line down the hall,\n Or what, finally, is at stake\n In a game of kickball.\n  \n It's time to draw a tree.\n What a relief to work alone,\n Serious thinks, as he picks a scab\n For just the right tinge of sky,\n Breaks his sugar cookie\n To make a place of stone,\n And fashions out of bread\n A man with a huge head\n And huge, ruined wings,\n Gasping at all the ruined things\n To which he's tumbled.\n And calls it: Cookie, Crumbled.\n  \nOh my, the teacher says\n When she walks by,\nThose are interesting trees. \n Serious closes his eyes and sees\n As in a vision of doom\n Himself drowning in schools,\n A whole ocean of fools\n Nipping, nipping at him\n With their tiny, tiny teeth.\n And Serious sighs\n With a prophet's wisdom\n As he climbs up into his seat,\n Stares out across the room\n And like a prophet cries:\nYou're all going to die!\n  \n The class is a tomb.\n Serious, rigid, waits.\n A girl in pigtails giggles,\n Then another near the back.\n And as if along a fuse\n The giggling goes\n Up and down the rows\n Till someone makes a crack\n About his coat and tie\n And the laughter detonates.\n  \n Serious climbs slowly down\n Into that inferno of sound\n Which the teacher's shouts\n Are only driving higher,\n Packs up his lunchbox, his dignity,\n And his copy of Sartre,\n  \n And strides with a prophet's gaze\n Through all that derisive fire.\n Only once does he turn,\n Briefly, to look back through the blaze\n At the iron fact of his art,\n Smaller from here, but unburned.\n  \n  \n 5.\n Serious loves his Mum.\n And then he doesn't, quite.\n It's that way with everything--\n Baths and plums,\n The blessed silence of night.\n  \nWould you like to help with this?\n His mother asks\n As she rolls out biscuit dough\n And cuts it with a glass\n Or folds the clothes\n Still warm from the sun.\n But Serious knows\n He was born with a task,\n And though he touches the clothes\n And tastes the dough,\n Serious says, No.\n  \n Serious stays in the bath\n Until his skin is shriveled and cold,\n Eats himself sick on plums,\n Feels in the dark\n The dark he becomes,\n And cries out in the night for his Mum.\n  \n  \n 6.\n Serious is older now.\n He just is.\nThank God, Serious says,\n For whom childhood, that stupid carousel that never stops,\n Always had an element of disingenuousness:\n The tristesse of lollipops,\n The sham of naps;\n Fools dandling you on their laps\n So you can play horsey, which damn sure isn't serious;\n And all that endless business\n Of pretending to be curious\n About the most obvious things:\n What's night? Where's Mama-Cat?\n What's wrong with Pop? Can God die?\n Why, why, why?\n  \n To hell with that,\n Serious thinks, as he sits incinerating memories\n One by one,\n Saying their names as he feeds them\n Like photographs to a fire:\n Here he is in a baseball uniform\n Squinting back the sun;\n Here in a blue tuxedo with a ruffled front;\n And here, Lord, with pimples.\n He pauses a moment.\n Do memories have names?\n And what, exactly, are these flames?\n To hell with that!\n Done.\n  \n Serious owns a car, pays taxes,\n Contemplates a pension,\n Has a crease of gray along his temples,\n But he is young, young.\n He develops headaches, begins sleeping badly, and relaxes,\n You might say, into the constant tension\n That he really always was,\n With far, far too much to do\n To look anywhere but onward,\n Or to answer the questions of a child\n With anything true.\n  \n  \n 7.\n Serious isn't Stupid,\n Though they go to the same gym.\n Serious sees him dropping weights\n Or picking his butt and thinks,\n At least I'm not him.\n Nor is he Mean or Vain,\n Those chiseled twins\n With matching boots and belts,\n Nor Smug who notes their sins,\n Nor Shallow noting something else;\n He isn't useless Timid\n Who no matter what won't complain,\n Nor fat-assed Nice sweating honey\n On all the machines,\n Nor Self-Loathing who smudges mirrors,\n Nor Whacked who licks them clean.\n Serious isn't Funny.\n  \n Serious spreads his towel on the bench,\n Sits down in front of his own image,\n And Serious strains at a serious weight.\n And never, not once, when he's seen\n In myriad mirrors around the room\n That everyone else is straining too,\n Has he caught himself too late\n And finished with a roar\n And more strength\n Than he's ever had before:\nI AM NOT YOU!\n  \n  \n 8.\n Serious has a date with Doom.\n It's not the first, and seems unlikely to be the last,\n For they get on quite well, Doom and he,\n Share similar pasts\n And similar ideas about what life should be.\n It seems, in fact, that this might just bloom.\n  \n And what a relief.\n After Morose and Mad and Neurotic;\n After almost falling for Grief,\n Who was so exotic\n She made all the others seem tame.\n Then to discover she even lied about her name.\n And to sleep with another Serious! That was odd,\n Like wrestling with an angel,\n Though it was hard to tell from that rough unsated tangle\n Which one was Serious, and which one God.\n  \n But how easy it is to be himself with Doom,\n Serious thinks, as he puts the wine in to chill\n And sets two glasses on a tray,\n Who always wants whatever Serious wants\n And always agrees with what he has to say;\n Who doesn't need to hear that whole spiel\n About \"going too fast\" or \"needing more room\";\n And who doesn't probe and pry that long needle into his brain\n --What do you feel? What do you feel?--\n Until it's all Serious can do not to stand up and scream: Pain!\n  \n Lucky to be alive.\n And if he still has no clear idea where she lives,\n And never knows quite when she'll arrive,\n Still, something about Doom feels right\n To Serious, and he looks forward to their dates.\n He checks himself in the mirror, dims the light,\n And waits.\n  \n  \n 9.\n Serious is a traveler.\n \"Traveling broadens the mind,\"\n The man beside him says,\n His tray table down and seat reclined\n Even as they're taking off,\n And Serious, who has his eyes closed\n So he can do what Serious does,\n Begins to cough.\n  \n                What do they say, what do they fear, \n                Is this song joy or grief? \n                This is a man, this is a god. \n                Who are you and why are you here? \n                To leave, to leave.\n  \n The meal is over,\n Which Serious declined.\n In the shell-roar of the cabin\n He eases somewhat, is surprised to find\n He could almost drift away.\n \"What line of work are you in?\"\n He hears the man beside him say,\n And Serious begins coughing wildly again.\n  \n                What is that smell, what was that sound, \n                Isn't that ice on the wings? \n                This is the air, there is the water, \n                But what do you do on the way down? \n                You scream, you scream.\n  \n How far they must have gone by now,\n That old familiar world miles behind,\n The man eats an orange,\n And now he eats the rind.\n He eats his plate, his plastic fork, chews\n With animal relish his Styrofoam cup,\n Leans over to eat bittersweet Serious too,\n Who startles and wakes up.\n  \n                Look at the desert, look at the green, \n                Is there an end to that ice? \n                Here is a place, and here is a place, \n                But what is the space between? \n                It's life, it's life.\n  \n  \n 10.\n Serious is married.\n What a weird wind this is,\n He thinks, so still at times,\n Then stinging the eyes to tears.\n And how he seems both more and less\n Himself, and how it seems at once all of loneliness\n And something he can hold.\n Or is it he who's being carried?\n He shivers, and reaches out for her again.\n Or is it she who reaches, she who's cold?\n What is this wind?\n Where are these years?\n  \n  \n 11.\n Serious experiences loss.\n Just like that.\n Flat.\n Serious experiences loss,\n  \n As if he'd come to some sheer cliff\n There was no way around,\n No way to cross,\n And found,\n On the other side\n Of a deep canyon, himself,\n Experiencing loss.\n  \n Serious, when the man is gone,\n Tells himself that he tried,\n Tells himself that he cried and cried\n For all he was worth\n To the man sitting on the other side\n Experiencing loss,\n Who one day simply vanished, or moved on,\n Or slipped off the edge of the earth\n And died.\n  \n  \n 12.\n Serious doesn't speak French.\n This embarrasses Serious,\n Because insofar as he lives anywhere,\n Serious lives in Paris.\n  \n He feels the city stare,\n Feels himself sweat, and shake, as he tries to wrench\n The little that he's gleaned\n Into the lot that he desires;\n Feels shopkeepers look at him as if he were a liar,\n Waiters as if he were unclean;\n  \n And feels, in truth, not at all serious,\n As if he had a huge balloon for a head\n And helium squeaks for a voice,\n As if gravity could be merely a choice\n He were making, and he might instead\n Simply stop, let go, and drift away.\n  \n Finally Serious, opposed to epiphanies,\n Has one he can't resist.\n He is Serious, and to be Serious\n Is to know something utterly or not at all,\n And to know, moreover,\n That as you let your half-knowledge fall\n From you, it does not exist.\n  \n Just like that Serious is himself again,\n Saying weighty things\n About the flowers in the stalls,\n Pondering a splendid mirage\n Called the Seine.\n  \n And if he wakes saying fromage,\n Or in some shop feels\n Right on the verge of translating please,\n Serious knows it's a dream,\n And knows from childhood what to do.\n Point and scream\n Until the damn fools give you cheese.\n  \n  \n 13.\n Serious has some culture.\n He knows some things.\n And if, as he begins to speak,\n He should feel the immense wings\n Of ignorance shadowing him, that dirty vulture\n That squawks in drawl and drips tobacco juice,\n Serious knows what shelter to seek.\n  \n Pick a name and Bach is better.\n Modernism was powerful but diffuse.\n Life's drained out of pictures since the Renaissance.\n Technique! Technique! Technique!\n And about all that spastic flatulence\n Called contemporary art,\n Well, Serious hardly knows where to start.\n  \n Serious sits through opera without a yawn,\n Chews up books on which weaker teeth would shatter;\n He can tell you where one brushstroke lies,\n List the reasons courtly love is gone,\n Pluck the speck of subject matter\n From Henry James.\n Serious knows some things.\n  \n He thinks and thinks and thinks\n Until his ignorance shrinks\n To the tiniest of flies\n Alighting somewhere in the Louvre.\n Carefully, carefully, Serious creeps\n With his massive swatter,\n Saying, Don't move. Don't move.\n  \n  \n 14.\n Serious believes in nothing.\n It's a nice day, what should we do?\n What are you thinking?\n What's been bothering you?\n What's that you're drinking?\n  \n Serious spreads the paper on his lap\n To confirm what's new under the sun,\n Hears a tap, tap, tap \n Against the windowpane.\n  \nNothing ventured, nothing gained,\n Floats up from childhood like a bit of ash,\n And Serious, pausing, can almost see\n His old preacher, that atom bomb of idiocy\n Who every Sunday would explode.\n Still, Serious thinks, there's a truth to set you free.\n But who could survive the blast?\n  \nTap, tap, tap.\n  \n Serious skims the sports pages,\n Reads about a storm that rages\n Far out at sea.\n Some talking dog is taking office,\n Some country wiping out monuments, expunging its past.\n  \nTap, tap, tap.\n  \nGoddammit, Serious says, midway through a war,\n And thinks again of that old bore\n Who talked and talked and talked\n Until you felt your head loll and sway\n Like some huge flower on a tiny stalk\n That one good breeze would break;\n  \n And how you'd see him afterwards eating chicken fried steak,\n Chicken fried man,\n With a tiny transistor radio in his hand\n So he could listen to the football game;\n And how his face seethed and writhed with what seemed pain\n If he saw you coming to his booth,\n And he stared off as if some great truth\n Were finally, finally coming clear in that chicken fried brain\n And like a prophet he was going to stand up and shout--\n Until what plopped innocuously out\n Was your own name.\n  \nTap, tap, tap.\n  \n Serious puts aside the news of the day\n And walks to the only window there is.\n But there's no wind, not even the grass stirs.\n And anyway, there's no tree.\n Serious shrugs and turns away.\n Must just be me.\n  \n  \n 13.\n Serious sees a child\n In the playground across the street,\n Sees his huge stupid head and huge stupid feet\n As he tries to keep up with the games,\n And hears his sonar screams\n Of delight amid the other children's screams,\n And hears his timid weeping when they call him names.\n  \n Serious sees the child standing apart sometimes\n Driveling to himself in silly rhymes,\n And sees him pretend to look intently at the sky\n If Serious walks by,\n Or sees him simply stop and stare.\n  \n Gradually Serious starts seeing the child everywhere,\n In a store standing in an aisle,\n In the subway while\n Serious is trying to work on the way home,\n Or laughing with his family in a restaurant\n Where Serious eats alone.\n  \n Serious knows the truth.\n This child wants something, his whole nature is want.\n And it begins to be annoying,\n This novice cringing, all the imbecilic and cloying\n Tactics of being cute,\n The whole hangdog way he has of panhandling pity\n With his freckles and his missing tooth,\n Sitting all fidgety in his Sunday suit\n Or babbling happily as he's leaking snot;\n  \n And then the air he suddenly puts on of being serious\n When it's so obvious he's not.\n  \n Serious sees the child in the playground\n Standing to the side,\n Sees his face whiten and his eyes go wide\n As Serious crosses the street and strides\n Until his shadow swallows the child\n And leans down close enough for them to kiss.\nI don't have time for this,\n Serious says,\nI've got too much to do.\n  \n And the child says, Who are you?\n  \n  \n 16.\n Serious kills himself.\nNo, no,\n Shivering out of a dream,\n Starlight and the hard glitter\n Under the bridge's beam,\n Serious, Serious,\n Don't go.\n  \n Serious crawls out of bed,\n Feels the cold in the floor\n And thinks, suddenly, of lovely Mad\n (Where can she be?)\n Who'd bolt out of sleep and scream\nFarmers get up at four!\n It's three.\n  \n Serious makes himself a cup of coffee,\n Which he doesn't drink;\n Tries and fails to read,\n Tries and fails to think.\n Serious sits, and holds himself still,\n Minute by minute;\n Until the dawn finally comes\n And he is in it.\n  \n  \n 17.\n Serious lives alone.\n It's better this way, he tells himself,\n As he takes a pan from the pan shelf,\n A spatula from the spatula drawer,\n And fries two eggs the way he likes them:\n Yolks of stone.\n  \n No more gnats of chatter over breakfast.\n No more breakfast. It's noon.\n No one prancing by with only panties on\n When he's almost, almost broken through,\n Or singsonging outside his door\nSerious, O Serious, where are you?\n No more!\n  \n But what, finally, does Serious do?\n He sits, ignores the ringing phone,\n Looks at a wall\n On one of the last warm days of the year,\n And settles back into the lifelong call\n Of being serious,\n Which is to see, within that whiteness,\n Leaves being gently blown,\n And to feel their colors as they fall.\n  \n  \n 18.\n Serious gives a speech.\n He sets his papers on the podium,\n His glass within easy reach,\nTap, tap, taps the microphone.\n How vast this venue is.\n How absolute this darkness.\n  \nTo be serious is to be alone!\n Serious cries out with a triumphant look on his face,\n Waiting for the echoes to end\n Out there in all that space,\n Which the words at once define and extend.\n It takes a while, but they do die.\n The spotlight lasers in.\n He blinks hard, starts again.\n  \nTo know in every hand another's touch, \nTo hear a silence words only intensify, \nTo feel not too little but too much \nThis attenuated world--\n  \n Serious begins to sweat,\n Feels the back of his shirt grow wet;\n Looks down to see his papers swirled\n And scattered, the glass on the floor, broken.\n What's with this fucking light, he thinks,\n Or was it spoken?\n He glares out at the dark, impassive crowd\n And as if by force he could make them wake\n Hears his voice growing loud:\n  \nWhatever you most treasure you will break, \nWhatever you hold closest you will let go, \nThere is no place that you will not leave! \nBut to be serious--\n                                   Serious says,\n Quietly now, because he has them, they are his--\n  \nTo be serious, to be truly serious, is to know \nThat what you call your losses you cannot grieve, \nFor it was never quite these things that you wanted\n--This treasure, this touch, this one place--\nBut by such life to be haunted.\n  \n Brilliant!\n No notes, no flaws.\n Serious stands back and waits for applause.\n The hall is silent, utterly silent,\n The heat tropic.\n  \n Serious looks around, confused,\n Turns to the man who introduced him\n Then can't remember being introduced;\n And even given his credentials,\n This suddenly seems a most unlikely topic.\n  \n Serious tries to get out of the light,\n But the light goes where Serious goes.\n He blunders to the edge of the stage,\n A cliff\n Breaking off into a dark\n in which there's no movement, no voices, not one sigh.\n  \n Serious feels the rage\n Draining out of him, and feels a chill, and whispers,\nWhere am I?\n  \n  \n 19.\n Serious nears an end.\n It's cold and getting colder,\n And Serious, older,\n Sits outside thinking of his good friend,\n Who like so much of Serious is gone,\n And thinking of that godforsaken dawn\n After the one night of his life he spent outdoors.\n  \nTell me,\n His good friend said\n When Serious staggered out to the fire,\nWhich form would you say is higher,\nTragedy or comedy?\n  \n And Serious, who had stumbled full-bladdered\n In the night from a dream of bears,\n Then dreamed himself the object\n Of a dozen hungry stares,\n Who had swiveled, pissed into the tent,\n And sworn such things it would take a life to repent,\n Serious, exhausted Serious,\n Was silent.\n  \nBecause it's been troubling me,\nSerious, that the answer can only be tragedy.\nTo be conscious is to be conscious of\nLosing whatever it is that you most love,\nAnd thus an art that's truly great\nWill always have one deepest truth to tell,\nWhich is, my friend, this life is hell.\n  \n Serious looks at the sky. It's late.\n A small wind blows\n The trees, and Serious, shivering, knows\n He should head inside,\n That he is not well.\n But sitting here, letting his eyes close,\n Serious can almost see that lake\n Aflame with the early sun, and smell\n The sweet burn of that wood,\n And feel the way it seemed his heart would surely break\n Were it not for the strange lightness in his head\n As his friend smiled and said,\nBut maybe earth is the heaven of the good.\n  \n  \n 20.\n Serious talks to God.\n There's no one else left.\n His mind is mash,\n His world is ash,\n And Serious occasionally forgets himself,\n Though he is not, not Bereft,\n That sniveling idiot two doors down\n Who sits up late\n With only ashes in the grate\n And talks to God.\n  \nSee? Serious says. See?\nNothing.\n Serious spreads his arms magnanimously\n As if to give God the floor.\n God declines.\nThou know'st the first time that we smell the air\nWe wawl and cry,\n Serious says, louder than before.\nAnd then we wawl and cry some more,\nAnd then we die,\nAnd then we rot!\n Again he waits in case\n There's disagreement. There's not.\n  \n Serious scoffs, goes to brush his teeth,\n Forgets briefly to avert his eye\n From the mirror's glare\n And finds his father there,\n  \n That gentle baffled man\n Who, when there was no hope,\n When he couldn't even stand,\n Carved from a piece of soap\n A silly yellow duck\n And set it in a little yellow dish.\n Serious feels a tingling in his hair\n And mutters something close to a prayer,\nI wish, I wish...\n  \n The lights go out.\nGoddammit, Serious shouts\n As he trips and falls\n To his knees on the floor,\n Banging his head on the door\n As he tries to rise.\nGodDAMMIT! Serious cries.\n  \n The lights come on.\n His father's gone,\n But there, at the edge of the sink,\n Balances the little duck in the little dish\n No serious person would ever keep.\n Serious tries to think,\n Steadies himself as if at some brink,\n Decides he needs sleep,\n That's what he needs,\n Crawling fully clothed into his bed\n And pulling the covers to his chin\n Because, it seems, there's some strange wind\n  \n That's somehow gotten inside.\n So unlike Serious,\n To leave a door unclosed.\n  \n Yet here it is, gathering strength\n As it blows his books\n On the floor and it blows\n Right through his body and it blows\n Behind and below and above\n And out of the whirlwind a voice cries\n  \n                     Love\n  \nWhat?

That there's a world\n to which we've been, not oblivious, exactly,\n but so inside we couldn't see it, who now see nothing else?\n Heaven is over.

And then it's not.\n\n\n\n Once when my father's mother's health was failing\n and she found it more and more difficult to tend\n to the tiny family plot at Champion, Texas,\n which is less town than time at this point,\n a blink of old buildings and older longings the rare driver\n flashes past, I took it upon myself to salt the graves\n as I must have read somewhere would work for unwanted growths.\n As indeed it did.\n In the months after, every Sunday when we spoke,\n she thanked me for the blankness, the blackness,\n (my words, of course)\n this new ease I had allowed her mind.\n Until one day leaning over with flowers the leached earth\n opened and my eighty-year-old grandmother\n tumbled right down among the bones\n of the woman from whom she'd first emerged.\n To see that image you have to be that sky.\n It has to happen in you, that crushing calling viewless blue\n that is so deeply in you that it is not you.\n \"O, Law', honey, I like to died.\"\n\n\n You don't climb out of poverty so much as carry it with you.\n Some shell themselves with wealth.\n Some get and spend, get and spend, skimming existence like a Jesus lizard.\n But for those whose souls have known true want\n -- whose souls perhaps are true want -- \n money remains, in some sense, permanently inert,\n like an erotic thought that flashes through a eunuch's brain.\n In 1980 my father bought his first airplane,\n a scream-proof four-seater we crammed five inside,\n which he considerately slammed into a sorghum field alone.\n Unkillable, he killed the next ten years with work and wives,\n then bought another, and brought it down in the solitary fire\n that was his aspect and atmosphere. Homes, schemes,\n thirty years of savings plowed into a sign company (!)\n that did not, it turned out, exist.\n A hole is hard to carry.\n\n\n People ask if I believe in God and the verb is tedious to me.\n Not wrong, not offensive, not intrusive, not embarrassing.\n Tedious.\n Today I saw a hawk land on Elizabeth's chimney.\n It sat with its bone frown and banker's breast\n above the proud houses of Hamden.\n Are you with me? Then see,\n too, a lump of animate ash rising from the flue\n (or so it seems) to be a pigeon\n fluttering dumbly down\n next to that implacable raptor,\n suddening a world of strange relations\n wherein there is no need for fear, or far,\n or meat.\n\n\n There was a man made of airplane parts,\n one of which was always missing.\n He wandered the hospital grounds in search of a rudder,\n an aileron, or some other fragment\n that would let him fly from this place\n where he was not meant to be.\n There was a woman who emitted invective\n ceaselessly, dispassionately, an obscenity machine.\n One timid gentleman saved Saran wrap for five full years\n and every night wrought an ever-more-solid ball\n with which, it turned out, he planned to bash the skull\n of the first soul he saw the dawn God blessed his weapon.\n (A success story, alas.)\n Another man with anvil hands sat six months of nights in faith\n that there would come occasion of darkness, unguardedness, and vision\n sufficient to rip from its socket one of my father's bright blue eyes.\n (Ditto.)\n My father moved among them like a father.\n He attended and pacified, he instructed and consoled.\n Late to the trade, he worked too much,\n and trusted his heart, no doubt, more than he should,\n but was, by all accounts, at this one thing, and despite the end, good.\n\n\n For love read faith\n into these lines that so obviously lack it.\n For love let words turn to life\n in the way life turns to world\n under the observer's eye, the swirl\n of particles with their waves and entanglements,\n their chance and havoc, resolving\n into some one thing:\n a raptor on a rooftop, say.\n No power on earth can make it stay.\n But is it lost or released into formlessness\n when we look away?\n\n\n To be is to believe\n that the man or woman\n who inscribed with an idiosyncratic but demanding calligraphy\nFuck da money -- Trust no one\n on the rough blanket of the residential motel\n where my father spent the last two years of his rough residential life\n intended the note of defiant, self-conscious (da!) humor\n that left my father, whom I had not seen in years,\n and I, whom years had seen grow sere, far even from myself,\n erupting in laughter until we cried.\n\n\n Before my good friend's good dog died\n ten times a day she pressed her forehead to his\n \"to confirm the world and her place in it.\"\n Now she won't even say his name.\n Strange how the things that burn worst in one heart\n one must keep silent to keep.\n\n\n Ten to one you thought of men.\n The murderers, I mean.\n But no. This is a true story.\n There is another cell, you see,\n in which a woman I have known since childhood,\n and since childhood have known to be\n suspended on a wire of time but nimble-witted nonetheless,\n lies on the cold stone floor.\n She is even more naked than they have made her.\n She has killed no one not even herself.\n Punishment, perhaps, or some contagion of fate, finds her here,\n her hair shorn, both wrists wrapped, her eyes open,\n pondering the parable of perfect silence.\n\n\nRemember, he said, memory is a poor man's prison.\n Make to have and to love one live infinitive,\n then blessed my brow with the sign of the cross.\n I woke without a chance to ask the obvious:\n But what if all our songs are songs of loss?\n\n\n I felt nothing when you died, Father.\n (As if I ever called you that.)\n It is a long cold seep, this grief.\n The day itself was hot enough to make the devil sweat,\n as more than one person, with less than one mind, muttered to me.\n What I remember: two children, too tan\n and \"clad in famine\" (Dahlberg), look up\n from their parched front yard,\n their sad little sprinkler like a flower of hell.\n I don't mean I saw them, though I did.\n I mean they are what I remember, fleshed.\n That town. A hint of new prison business,\n and the Square's been rewhitened,\n but mostly it's beastly, a blast site,\n our old house less house than nest,\n and even the undertaker, a friend\n from high school, has graduated to heroin.\n You would have been right at home,\n and I guess in a ghoulish way you were,\n overdressed, overdosed, over.\n Hard wind at the graveside. Hard lives hardly there.\n The canopy whipped and flapped.\n A bouquet skipped over the graves like a strange elation.\n Something stuck, and an ageless Indian\n (he might have been Mom's long-dead granddad)\n nimbled over the casket's contraptions to make it go. You go\n into the ground again, and the silence assaults\n like heat, and the clumps of would-be grievers unclump\n and head for cars, and Mom cracks\n a tallboy and two jokes before we're on the highway.\n The first I forget, and of the second I recall only a nakedness, and wild crying,\n and a rat.\n\n\n When the doctor said I'd likely die I thought of my father\n telling me he'd learned to read a cancer look,\n that some people had it before they had it, so to speak.\n When the young guard demanded to unwrap the Snickers\n I'd bought for my sister my father scoffed:\n \"All this energy expended on candy when you could take this can\"\n -- he held her Coke up in front of our eyes -- \"and cut a throat.\"\n When my sister, chewing her chocolate with ravenous indifference,\n paused and stared balefully off at the even more baleful brown\n beyond the barbed wire, it did not occur to me\n that it was inspiration. When I began writing these lines\n it was not, to be sure, inspiration but desperation,\n to be alive, to believe again in the love of God.\n The love of God is not a thing one comprehends\n but that by which -- and only by which -- one is comprehended.\n It is like the child's time of pre-reflective being,\n and like that time, we learn it by its lack.\n Flashes and fragments, flashes and fragments,\n these images are not facets of some unknowable whole\n but entire existences in themselves, like worlds\n that under God's gaze shear and shear and, impossibly, are:\n untouching, entangled, sustained, free.\n If all love demands imagination, all love demands withdrawal.\n We must create the life creating us, and must allow that life to be -- \n and to be beyond, perhaps, whatever we might imagine.\n I, too, am more (and less)\n than anything I imagine myself to be.\n \"To know this,\" says Simone Weil, \"is forgiveness.\"\n\n\n It is an air you enter, not an act you make.\n It is the will's frustration, and is the will's fruition.\n It is to wade a blaze one night that I once crossed\n -- a young man, and lost -- \n to find a woman made of weather\n sweeping the street in front of her shack.\n It is another country.\n It is a language I don't know.\nLa por alla, la por alla, I repeat in my sleep.\n The over there.\n\n\n Tired of the mind reaching back in the past for rescue\n I praise the day\n my father woke in the motel room where all five of us were sleeping,\n which is not even past but a flame as I say it,\n and see it, the little lighter now he is using to find his clothes.\n I who have not slept in forty-five years am awake for the first time\n rising carefully out of my pallet on the floor\n and feeling my way beyond the bodies of my brother and sister\n toward the shade that is my father\n to stand in this implausible light where to whisper would be too much,\n and anyway what's next is known, Dad, and near,\n the nowhere diner, hot chocolate and the funny pages,\n and the consolation that comes when there is nothing to console."

Everything is black. Storm clouds gather\n out on Lake Erie. But the old flower-hatted women\n             at the Baptist church are heading out praise cards,\n registering teenagers to vote.

He has a cool new hat. He is speaking of dead\n black children. He is giving his time. To make the crowd\n             sway like wind through a field of corn.\n             Does LeBron think of dying?\n             Does the grape think of dying as it withers on the vine by\n the lake? Or does it dream of the wine it will become?\n He is wearing a shirt that says I Can't Breathe.\n They said he was arrogant. I said he was just Ohio.\n             He married his high school sweetheart. Bravado laid out\n on the court. No back down, he is Biggie with a basketball inside\n             of a mic, no ballistics, just ballet. He is Miles Davis cool,\n quietly cerebral, turning his back, tossing up\n             chalk like blue smoke, blue notes, blues.

He is third shift at the rubber\n             plant in winter, he is farm hands & auto parts piecework\n & long nights the men at the bar, eyes on the television.\n             The lake tonight is black as newly laid asphalt.\n There are no ellipses. He is turning paragraphs\n             into chapters. Long ago the hoop Gods made this deal\n at the crossroads, Old Scratch is flipping the pages\n             of his program & waiting high in the stands--to belong to a\n place most people would call\n             nowhere, to show the world how tough we truly are,\n twelve-hour shifts at the Rubber plant in Akron. How he is, how\n             he is a part of this asphalt court we call Ohio, & how we\n suffer, & how we shine."

        "Conversations with the Artist (2)": "My first teacher told me\n                that what sculpture involved\n was being a God.

Now I know\n                that these days such a view\n is against science, but the idea of a god is as real\n  \n as god is not.

Even when they watch\n you. Try not to consider what happened\n to the small girl staring furiously, the thin-faced\n woman wanly looking away. Do not think about\n what they had for breakfast, if the bread was hard.\n Certainly do not consider the odors underneath\n their arms and skirts. Do not allow a breeze into\n the room they sit in. Do not assume I am talking\n about any painting: step away from the subject.\n All subject. Was the painter in love? Do not ask\n the question. Imagine you are the painter,\n blocking out everything you don't want to see.\n Everything is out of the picture. Stop looking.\n Stop seeking what isn't there. Tuck your narratives\n back in your pocket. Look for perspective, light,\n shade. Let your eyes wander back to the girl.\n She is trying to say something but her mouth\n has been painted deliberately shut. Her lips, thin."

        "Sex Trafficking Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl in the USA (or, The Nation's Plague in Plain Sight)": "And now, reader, I come to a period in my unhappy life, which I would gladly forget if I could. Asia Graves looks  straight ahead as she calmly recalls the night a man paid $200 on a  Boston street to have sex with her.\n\n \nThe remembrance fills me with sorrow and shame. \"If you want attention and you see that you're getting it, you just follow your feelings,\" senior Araceli Figueroa, 17, said. \"It's sad.\"\n\n \nIt pains me to tell you of it; but I have promised to tell you the truth, and I will do it honestly, let it cost me what it may. A plague more commonly associated with other countries has been taking young victims in the United States, one by one.\n\n \nI will not try to screen myself behind the plea of compulsion from a master; for it was not so. \"They give you money, drugs and a fun time, but in the end they want your dignity and your self-respect,\" she said. \"It's invisible chains that these kids are tied with.\"\n\n \nNeither can I plead ignorance or thoughtlessness. By day, she was a school girl who saw her family occasionally.\n\n \nFor years, my master had done his utmost to pollute my mind with foul images, and to destroy the pure principles inculcated by my grandmother, and the good mistress of my childhood. The [outreach] efforts by high school and middle-school officials in Washington, D.C., Virginia, Connecticut, Oregon, Wisconsin, California and Florida come as experts say criminals have turned to classrooms and social media sites to recruit students into forced domestic sex and labor rings.\n\n \nThe influences of slavery had had the same effect on me that they had on other young girls; they had made me pre- maturely knowing, concerning the evil ways of the world. Sold from Boston to Miami and back, Graves was one of thousands  of young girls sexually exploited across the United States, often in  plain sight.\n\n \n\nThough the scope of the problem remains uncertain--no national statistics forthe number of U.S. victims exist--the National Center for Missing and Ex-ploited Children says at least 100,000 children across the country are traf-ficked each year. Globally, the International Labor Organization estimates that about 20.9 million people are trafficked and that 22% of them are victims of forced sexual exploitation.\n\n\n \nI knew what I did, and I did it with deliberate calculation. From ages 14 to 17, [Katariina Rosenblatt] says she was drugged, abused, raped and trafficked by several people including [a class mate's] father's friends, a neighbor who ran a trafficking house, and man who offered her a role in a movie.\n\n \nBut, O, ye happy women, whose purity has been sheltered from childhood, who have been free to choose the objects of your affection, whose homes are protected by law, do not judge the poor desolate slave girl too severely! \"I want  to raise the compassion bar so that any girl who becomes a victim is  never seen as a girl who asked for it,\" said Andrea Powell, executive  director of Fair Girls.\n\n \nAmong others, it chanced that a white unmarried gentle-man had obtained some knowledge of the circumstances in which I was placed. He knew my grandmother, and often spoke to me in the street. The perpetrators--increasingly younger--can be other students or gang members who manipulate victims' weaknesses during recess or after school, law enforcement  officials say.\n\n \nHe became interested for me, and asked questions about my master, which I answered in part. He expressed a great deal of sympathy, and a wish to aid me. At night, she became  a slave to men who said they loved her and convinced her to trade her  beauty for quick cash that they pocketed.\n\n \nHe constantly sought opportunities to see me, and wrote to me frequently. They often bait victims by telling them they will be beautiful strippers or escorts but later pry them with drugs--ecstasy pills, cocaine, marijuana and the like--and force them into sex schemes.\n\n \nI was a poor slave girl, only fifteen years old. She was 16, homeless, and desperate for food, shelter and stability.\n\n \nSo much attention from a superior person was, of course, flattering; for human nature is the same in all. She was alone on a corner in Boston during a snowstorm when her first trafficker picked her up.\n\n \nI also felt grateful for his sympathy, and encouraged by his kind words. Young people at the fringes of school, runaways look- ing for someone to care and previously abused victims fall into the traps of traffickers who often pretend to love them.\n\n \nIt seemed to me a great thing to have such a friend. \"He said  I was too pretty to stay outside, so I ended up going home with him because he offered me a place to sleep and clothes to put on,\" she said.\n\n \nBy degrees, a more tender feeling crept into my heart. \"It's about love and thinking you're part of a family and a team.\"\n\n \nHe was an educated and eloquent gentleman; too eloquent, alas, for the poor slave girl who trusted in him. \"When a little girl is sold by her impoverished family, or girls my daughters' ages run away from home and are lured--that's slavery,\" [President] Obama said. \"It's barbaric, it's evil, and it has no place in a civilized world.\"\n\n \nOf course I saw whither all this was tending. The man said  he wanted to take care of her but that she would have to earn her keep.  \"He showed me the ropes,\" she said. \"How much to charge for sex\"  and other sex acts.\n\n \n\nI knew the impassable gulf between us; but to be an object of interest to a man who is not married, and who is not her master, is agreeable to the pride and feelings of a slave, if her miserable situation has left her any pride or sentiment.\n\n\n \nIt seems less degrading to give one's self, than to submit to compulsion. She stayed, however, and found comfort in other girls--called \"wife in-laws\"--who went to area schools, got their hair and nails done together and then worked the streets for the same man.\n\n \nThere is something akin to freedom in having a lover who has no control over you, except that which he gains by kindness and attachment. Then came the violence. Her attempts to leave were met with brute force. \"He punched me. He stripped me  down naked and beat me.\"\n\n \nA master may treat you as rudely as he pleases, and you dare not speak; moreover, the wrong does not seem so great with an unmarried man, as with one who has a wife to be made unhappy. Other violent episodes left her with eight broken teeth, two broken ankles and a V-shaped stab wound just be- low her belly button.\n\n \nThere may be sophistry in all this; but the condition of a slave confuses all principles of morality, and, in fact, renders the practice of them impossible. \"You think what you're doing is right when you're in that lifestyle,\" Graves said. \"You drink  alcohol to ease the stress. Red Bulls kept you awake, and cigarettes  kept you from being hungry.\"\n \n \nI was sure my friend, Mr. Sands, would buy me. For two years, she was sold from tormentor to tormentor, forced to sleep with men in cities like New York, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Atlantic City, Miami.\n\n \nHe was a man of more generosity and feeling than my master, and I thought my freedom could be easily obtained from him. \"They said they were escorts and that they made $2,000  a night. I figured if I go out one night, I'll never have to do it again.\"\n\n \n\n\"You can sell drugs once,\" says Alessandra Serano, an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of California. \"You can sell a girl thousands of times.\"\n\n\n \nWith all these thoughts revolving in my mind, and seeing no other way of escaping the doom I so much dreaded, I made a headlong plunge. He was the first of dozens of men who would buy her thin cashew-colored body from a human trafficker who exploited her vulnerabilities and made her a prisoner for years.\n\n \nPity me, and pardon me, O virtuous reader! \"They are as hor- rific and brutal and vile as any criminal cases we see,\" said Neil MacBride, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\n \nYou never knew what it is to be a slave; to be entirely un-protected by law or custom; to have the laws reduce you to the condition of a chattel, entirely subject to the will of an-other. \"I couldn't leave because I thought he would kill me.\"\n\n \nYou never exhausted your ingenuity in avoiding the snares, and eluding the power of a hated tyrant; you never shuddered at the sound of his footsteps, and trembled within hearing of his voice. \"If we didn't call him daddy, he would slap us, beat us, choke us,\" said Graves of the man who organized the deals.\n\n \nI know I did wrong. No one can feel it more sensibly than I do. The painful and humiliating memory will haunt me to my dying day. One girl was sold during a sleepover, handed over by her classmate's father. Another slept with clients during her school lunch breaks. A third was choked by her \"boyfriend,\" then forced to have sex with 14 men in one night.\n\n \nStill, in looking back, calmly, on the events of my life, I feel that the slave woman ought not to be judged by the same standard as others. For some of the time, Graves herself remained  in high school, attending classes sporadically in boy shorts, small tank tops and worn heels. \"In the schools, they thought I just dressed  provocatively,\" Graves said of the teachers and staff who missed  chances to help her. \"Now, people are actually understanding that  these girls are victims.\"\n\n \n\nWhat could I do? I thought and thought, till I became desperate, and made a plunge into the abyss.",

        "More Experiments with the Mysterious Property of Animal Magnetism (1769)": "Finding myself in a mesmeric orientation,\n before me appeared Benjamin Franklin,\n who magnetized his French paramours\n at dinner parties as an amusing diversion\n from his most serious studies of electricity\n and the ethereal fire. I like thinking about\n how he would have stood on tiptoe to kiss\n their buzzing lips and everyone would gasp\n and clap for the blue spark between them.\n I believe in an honest and forthright manner,\n a democracy of plain speech, so I have to\n find a way to explain I don't care to have sex\n anymore. Once I was a high school teacher\n and there was a boy who everyday came in late,\n who only came to school at all to sell drugs\n out of his backpack, upon which he laid\n his head like a pillow and closed his eyes\n while I pointed at a chart diagramming\n the anatomy of a sparrow. The vice principal\n was watching and taking notes as I taught\n this class, so I slid the bag from under\n his cheek, as if not to wake him, wrapped\n his fingers around a pen. I was trying\n to be a gentle mother and also trying\n to show I was in control of an unstable\n situation. The boy, also trying to be\n in control of himself, walked so slow\n to my desk and we stood to watch him\n push everything--binders, piles of ungraded\n papers, a beaker of red pens to the floor.\n He was so calm. How do you like it when \nI touch your things. I do not like it. I live\n in a house with many blue mason jars,\n each containing a feather collection or starfish\n collection or vertebrae collection, and also\n there is a fully articulated fetal alligator skeleton.\n Each window is pressed by the design\n of a sweet-gum branch, all the little orange\n and red stars of its leaves, you can't see\n the perfect geometry this close, just haphazard\n parabolas, but beneath the foundation\n the roots mirror the branching. I have\n a chart of this to pull down. The view is flat\n and so quiet on the inside. Have I been\n forthright yet? What I want to know is\n what happens if I decide to never have sex\n again? Or more precisely, can I decide\n to not have sex again and still be kind?\n And be a joy to others? I should mention\n I am a wife. I should mention I was told\n my sole purpose is to be joy to others.\n The sidewalks outside are very full of people\n and when I look at them I feel hopeless.\n Benjamin Franklin was so jolly with his kite\n and his key and his scandalous electricity.\n He was so in love with women and drink\n and democracy. Before I was this way,\n I was not a house, I was just a jar and what\n I wanted was to be broken. A cool trick\n you can do that I once showed a class is crank\n a wheel covered in felt against another felt\n wheel. Static bristles and sparks and makes\n your hair stand on end. But hook it to\n a Leyden jar and the electricity fills up\n in there, invisible as air. Becomes a glass\n battery, until you too much the thing, then\n wow! broken glass everywhere. I remember\n wanting that. Do I have to always want that?\n My house is blue and quiet. I can hardly\n hear the squirrel in my sweet-gum tree\n dancing like a sunbeam to sing his riddles:\n \"A house full, a hole full, but you cannot\n gather a bowl full.\" The air of everywhere\n is wet with electric fluid, you can't even tell,\n but pop, whiz, everywhere. \"In this\n field,\" Ben says, \"the soul has room\n enough to expand, to display all of her\n extravagances.\" The sweet gum has 10,000\n sticky, spiky seed balls. They start green\n but grow black and fall for want of\n a barren season. They look like sea urchins.\n I call them tree urchins and think it's\n a funny joke. I don't tell it to anyone,\n as I am tired of being told what is not.\n Such a secret, I know, is an extravagance,\n and I like best how it's an extravagance so\n small you must keep it in a jar with others\n of its kind for it to ever mean anything at all.",
        "Toad": "My child is sitting cross-legged on the floor reading to herself.\n Sometimes she is so full of need I push her to the floor.\n Only once I did that and I don't even remember the moment\n right, but I was trying to wipe urine off my leg and she was\n naughty like a squirrel and jumping and singing and her head\n slammed into my chin, which hurt and even more than that,\n it pissed me off, because she's my beautiful child, but in that\n button snap of a moment she was suddenly just one more person\n and I pushed her away in a way that felt to me like setting her\n down, but awkwardly, because of how she was also balancing\n her feet on my feet as I tried to pour out a bowl of pee\n from her little potty as a toothbrush dangled foaming\n from my mouth. Somewhere in the mess of that morning\n she'd become person enough to, in the space between us,\n create force of momentum, and then I did not set her down,\n but pushed her and she fell away from it against the wall\n and was crying because I, her mommy, pushed her. And I know\n this should be the poem about how I'm horrified at myself,\n the poem about what in ourselves we have to live with,\n but in that moment which followed two years of breastfeeding\n and baby-wearing and sixty-nine hours of natural childbirth\n and the hemorrhaging and the uncertain operation, after which\n I pumped every two hours, careful not to let the cord tangle\n in the IV. Even then when she cried and no matter what\n and no matter and no matter and no matter and no matter what,\n I held her all night if she cried so she would not ever know\n someday you'll cry alone, but I held her and ached and leaked\n and bled too as long as it took. Of course there've been nights\n since but sometimes it feels as if I've never been asleep again,\n so when I say I pushed my two-year-old against a wall and I don't\n remember it happening that way but it happened and I did\n and I've been wondering a long time now what the limit is\n and when I would find the end of myself, and that day, which\n was yesterday, was the end. And this day, when we played\n hide-and-seek with Daddy, and touched bugs, and read\nFrog and Toad Are Friends twice together before she read it\n to herself as I wrote this, this is the day that comes after.",

        "Translations": "I want to believe we can't see anything\n we don't have a word for.\n  \n When I look out the window and say green, I mean sea green,\n I mean moss green, I mean gray, I mean pale and also\n electrically flecked with white and I mean green\n in its damp way of glowing off a leaf.\n  \n Scheele's green, the green of Renaissance painters,\n is a sodium carbonate solution heated to ninety degrees\n as arsenious oxide is stirred in. Sodium displaces copper,\n resulting in a green precipitate that is sometimes used\n as insecticide. When I say green I mean\n a shiny green bug eating a yellow leaf.\n  \n Before synthetics, not every painter could afford a swathe\n of blue. Shocking pink, aka neon, aka kinky pink,\n wasn't even on the market. I want to believe Andy Warhol\n invented it in 1967 and ever since no one's eyes\n have been the same. There were sunsets before,\n but without that hot shocking neon Marilyn, a desert sky\n was just cataract smears. I want to believe this.\n  \n The pale green of lichen and half-finished leaves\n filling my window is a palette very far from carnation\n or bougainvillea, but to look out is to understand it is not,\n is to understand what it is not. I stare out the window a lot.\n Between the beginning and the end the leaves unfolded.\n I looked out one morning and everything was unfamiliar\n as if I was looking at the green you could only see\n if you'd never known synthetic colors existed.\n  \n I've drawn into myself people say.\n We understand, they say.\n  \n There are people who only have words for red\n and black and white, and I wonder if they even see\n the trees at the edge of the grass\n or the green storms coming out of the west.\n There are people who use the same word for green\n and red and brown, and I wonder if red\n seems so urgently bright pouring from the body\n when there is no green for it to fall against.\n  \n In his treatise on color Wittgenstein asked,\n \"Can't we imagine certain people\n having a different geometry of colour than we do?\"\n  \n I want to believe the eye doesn't see green until it has a name,\n because I don't want anything to look the way it did before.\n  \n Van Gogh painted pink flowers, but the pink faded\n and curators labeled the work \"White Roses\" by mistake.\n  \n The world in my window is a color the Greeks called chlorol.\n When I learned the word I was newly pregnant\n and the first pale lichens had just speckled the silver branches.\n The pines and the lichens in the chill drizzle were glowing green\n and a book in my lap said chlorol was one of the untranslatable\n words. The vibrating glow pleased me then, as a finger\n dipped in sugar pleased me then. I said the word aloud\n for the baby to hear. Chlorol. I imagined the baby\n could only see hot pink and crimson inside its tiny universe,\n but if you can see what I'm seeing, the word for it\n is chlorol. It's one of the things you'll like out here.\n  \n Nineteenth century critics mocked painters who cast shadows\n in unexpected colors. After noticing green cypresses do drop red\n shadows, Goethe chastised them. \"The eye demands\n completeness and seeks to eke out the colorific circle in itself.\"\n He tells of a trick of light that had him pacing a row of poppies\n to see the flaming petals again and figure out why.\n  \n Over and over again Wittgenstein frets the problem of translucence.\n Why is there no clear white?\n He wants to see the world through white-tinted glasses,\n but all he finds is mist.\n  \n At first I felt as if the baby had fallen away\n like a blue shadow on the snow.\n  \n Then I felt like I killed the baby\n in the way you can be thinking about something else\n and drop a heavy platter by mistake.\n  \n Sometimes I feel like I was stupid\n to have thought I was pregnant at all.\n  \n Color is an illusion, a response to the vibrating universe\n of electrons. Light strikes a leaf and there's an explosion\n where it lands. When colors change, electromagnetic fields\n are colliding. The wind is not the only thing moving the trees.\n  \n Once when I went into those woods I saw a single hot pink orchid\n on the hillside and I had to keep reminding myself not to\n tell the baby about the beautiful small things I was seeing.\n So, hot pink has been here forever and I don't even care\n about that color or how Andy Warhol showed me an orchid.\n I hate pink.

        "When Black Men Drown Their Daughters": "When black, men drown. They spend their whole lifetimes\n justifying the gall of springing the trap, the inconvenience\n of slouched denim, of coupling beyond romance or aim.\n All the while, the rising murk edges toward their chins.\n Hurriedly, someone crafts another scientific tome, a giddy\n exploration of the curious dysfunction identifying black\n men first as possible, then as necessary. Elegant equations\n succumb to a river that blurs quotient and theory, rendering\n them unreadable, and the overwhelm easily disappears\n the men, their wiry heads glistening, then gulped. All that's\n left is the fathers' last wisdom, soaked wreckage on silver:\nGirl, that water ain't nothing but wet. I'm gon' be alright.\n  \n When black men drown, their daughters turn to their mothers\n and ask What should I do with this misnamed shiver in my\nleft shoulder? How should I dress in public? They are weary\n of standing at the shore, hands shading their eyes, trying\n to make out their own fathers among the thousands bobbing\n in the current. The mothers mumble and point to any flailing\n that seems familiar. Mostly, they're wrong. Buoyed by church\n moans and comfort food of meat and cream, the daughters\n try on other names that sound oddly broken when pressed\n against the dank syllables of the fathers'. Drained, with just\nforward in mind, they walk using the hip of only one parent.\n They scratch in their sleep. Black water wells up in the wound.\n  \n When black men drown, their daughters are fascinated with\n the politics of water, how gorgeously a surface breaks\n to receive, how it weeps so sanely shut. And the thrashing\n of hands, shrieking of names: I was Otis, I was Willie Earl,\nthey called me Catfish. Obsessed by the waltzing of tides,\n the daughters remember their fathers--the scorch of beard\n electrifying the once-in-a-while kiss, the welts in thick arms,\n eyes wearied with so many of the same days wedged behind\n them. When black men drown, their daughters memorize all\n the steps involved in the deluge. They know how long it takes\n for a weakened man to dissolve. A muted light, in the shape\n of a little girl, used to be enough to light a daddy's way home.\n  \n When black men drown, their daughters drag the water's floor\n with rotting nets, pull in whatever still breathes. They insist their\n still-dripping daddies sit down for cups of insanely sweetened\n tea, sniffs of rotgut, tangled dinners based on improbable swine.\n The girls hope to reacquaint their drowned fathers with the concept\n of body, but outlines slosh in drift and retreat. The men can't get\n dry. Parched, they scrub flooded hollows and weep for water\n to give them name and measure as mere blood once did. Knocking\n over those spindly-legged dinette chairs, they interrupt the failed\n feast and mutter Baby girl, gotta go, baby gotta go, their eyes\n misted with their own murders. Grabbing their girls, they spit\n out love in reverse and stumble toward the banks of some river.\n  \n When black men drown their daughters, the rash act is the only\n plausible response to the brain's tenacious mouth and its dare: Yes, \nyes, open your ashed hands and release that wingless child. Note\n the arc of the sun-drenched nosedive, the first syllable of the child's\n name unwilling from the man's mouth, the melody of billow that\n begins as blessed clutch. Someone crouching inside the father waits\n impatiently for the shutting, the lethargic envelop, and wonders if\n the daughter's wide and realizing eye will ever close to loose him.\n It never will, and the man and his child and the daughter and her\n father gaze calmly into the wrecked science of each other's lives.\n The sun struggles to spit a perfect gold upon the quieting splash.\n The river pulses stylish circles of its filth around the swallow.",

I wish I could\n have some small memory of her\n warm and spicy mouth to wrap\n these hungry words around. I\n  \n would like to have danced with her,\n to have slow-cooked to a slow song\n in her sleek, toffee arms: her body\n balanced between the Temptations' \n five voices and me--a boy anointed\n  \n with puberty, a kid with a B\n average and a cool best friend.\n I don't think I've ever understood\n how lonely I am, but I was\n  \n closer to it at fifteen because\n I didn't know anything: my heart\n so near the surface of my skin\n  \n I could have moved it with my hand.",

        "Donna James": "I remember that first time:\n the empty auditorium, her voice,\n the dark all around us,\n her mouth reaching into mine.\n She was Freddy's foxy older sister,\n and I didn't know why\n she wanted to kiss me. She\n had already finished high school\n and probably shouldn't have\n been walking the halls, but\n she always called me her friend.\n So one Monday after gym,\n  \n I found myself beside myself\n in front of her house--with my\n trench coat and lunch bag--\n probably not looking much\n like Shaft. Inside, the air held\n warm milk and we talked a bit\n about her baby    and her Aunt\n who paid the rent painting cars.\n  \n Maybe she liked me because\n we were both black and mostly\n alone in the suburbs, but I hadn't\n thought about that. It was her voice\n that got me--banked fire, the color\n of dusk--her voice, and my name\n was smoke in her mouth.\n  \n I think about it more than I should now,\n that January noon--an hour before\n algebra--how most days I'd be\n thinking football    or replaying\n the seventy-some kisses I'd gotten\n over those lean years, but that day\n  \n Donna and me were on the couch\n munching potato chips. Rrruffles \nhave rrridges, she kidded coming\n from checking the baby who'd\n slipped into a nap. I was kind of\n disappointed that we hadn't\n done anything, but I needed time\n to get back to school, so I started\n to stand. She said wait, \nlook at this mess,\n  \n and with her left hand, she\n brushed the crumbs from my lap\n the way you'd whisk away lint--\n then, swept over my pants again--\n to be thorough, I guessed, but slower\n and then some more, as if her hand\n  \n were getting    drowsy. You know\n how sometimes you see something\n but just can't believe it--like a squirrel\n bobbling a biscuit on your kitchen counter\n or a cricket creeping the red feathers\n of your mother's Sunday hat?\n  \n Her hand there, on my lap,\n could easily have been a five-fingered\n flying saucer from the fifth dimension.\n For awhile, I just watched and\n wondered if she knew where\n her hand had landed    but it was me\n who didn't know: me with my\n six dozen kisses and the great Eden\n of my virginity. How\n do we not talk about it\n  \n every day: the ways\n we were changed\n by the gift\n in someone's touch--your body,\n suddenly a bright instrument\n played by an otherwise\n silent divinity.\n  \n When I heard my zipper, I couldn't\n have said where my arms\n were    or what a clock was for:\n I had\n no idea    I could be such a stranger\n and still be myself. How could I\n have known what a girl\n  \n might do to a boy\n with her mouth     if she felt\n like doing what her mouth\n could do? It was\n a kind of miracle: the dreamed\nimpossible--my soul finally called\n to my flesh. I didn't know\n what I didn't know    and then I knew.",

No one quite grasps\n the reality of the situation and everyone spends that first day\n talking about what happened and reliving it as language--\n not so much to understand the violence but to make a\n kind of recording of it: talking about it, letting go of it,\n putting it down.

Liz is in her car after having just picked up\n Lily at school and driving back home through a town that\n suddenly makes no sense and she is telling the story about\n what happened when a young man walked into a building\n with a gun.

One scramble was\n For the rocket that delivers the explosion that burns humans\n By the tens of thousands and poisons the earth in the process.\n They were wondering if the terrorist was crazy. If he was\n A terrorist, maybe he was just unhappy. The other\n Challenge afterwards was how to construct machine guns\n A man or a boy could carry: lightweight, compact, easy to\n      assemble.\n First a Russian sergeant, a Kalashnikov, clever with guns\n Built one on a German model. Now the heavy machine gun.\n The weapon of European imperialism through which\n A few men trained in gunnery could slaughter native armies\n In Africa and India and the mountains of Afghanistan,\n Became \"a portable weapon a child can operate.\"\n The equalizer. So the undergunned Vietnamese insurgents\n Fought off the greatest army in the world. So the Afghans\n Fought off the Soviet army using Kalashnikovs the CIA\n Provided to them. They were throwing powders in the fire\n And dancing. Children's armies in Africa toting AK-47s\n That fire thirty rounds a minute. A round is a bullet.\n An estimated 500 million firearms on the earth.\n 100 million of them are Kalashnikov-style semi-automatics.\n They were dancing in Orlando, in a club. Spring night.\n Gay Pride. The relation of the total casualties to the history\n Of the weapon that sent exploded metal into their bodies--\n 30 rounds a minute, or 40, is a beautifully made instrument,\n And in America you can buy it anywhere--and into the history\n Of the shaming culture that produced the idea of Gay Pride--\n They were mostly young men, they were dancing in a club,\n A spring night. The radio clicks on. Green fire. Blue fire.\n The immense flocks of terrified birds still rising\n In wave after wave above the waters in the dream time.\n Crying out sharply. As the French ship breasted the vast\n      interior\n Of the new land. America. A radio clicks on. The Arabs,\n A commentator is saying, require a heavy hand. Dancing.",
        "Meditation at Lagunitas": "All the new thinking is about loss.\n In this it resembles all the old thinking.\n The idea, for example, that each particular erases\n the luminous clarity of a general idea. That the clown-\n faced woodpecker probing the dead sculpted trunk\n of that black birch is, by his presence,\n some tragic falling off from a first world\n of undivided light. Or the other notion that,\n because there is in this world no one thing\n to which the bramble of blackberry corresponds,\n a word is elegy to what it signifies.\n We talked about it late last night and in the voice\n of my friend, there was a thin wire of grief, a tone\n almost querulous. After a while I understood that,\n talking this way, everything dissolves: justice,\n pine, hair, woman, you and I. There was a woman\n I made love to and I remembered how, holding\n her small shoulders in my hands sometimes,\n I felt a violent wonder at her presence\n like a thirst for salt, for my childhood river\n with its island willows, silly music from the pleasure boat,\n muddy places where we caught the little orange-silver fish\n called pumpkinseed. It hardly had to do with her.\n Longing, we say, because desire is full\n of endless distances. I must have been the same to her.\n But I remember so much, the way her hands dismantled bread,\n the thing her father said that hurt her, what\n she dreamed.

Otherwise\n the restaurants could just put \"fish\" up on their signs,   \n and when he woke--he'd slept for hours, curled up   \n on the girder like a child--the sun was going down\n and he felt a little better, and afraid. He put on the jacket   \n he'd used for a pillow, climbed over the railing   \n carefully, and drove home to an empty house.\n\n There was a pair of her lemon yellow panties\n hanging on a doorknob. He studied them. Much-washed.   \n A faint russet in the crotch that made him sick   \n with rage and grief. He knew more or less\n where she was. A flat somewhere on Russian Hill.   \n They'd have just finished making love.

He went out onto the porch, and listened   \n to the forest in the summer dark, madrone bark\n cracking and curling as the cold came up.\n\n It's not the story though, not the friend\n leaning toward you, saying \"And then I realized--,\"\n which is the part of stories one never quite believes.   \n I had the idea that the world's so full of pain\n it must sometimes make a kind of singing.\n And that the sequence helps, as much as order helps--\n First an ego, and then pain, and then the singing.",

Lady of eyelashes,\n do you hear me? Whiteness, otter's body,\n coolness of the morning, rubbed amber\n and the skin's salt, do you hear me? This is Poland speaking,\n \"era of the dawn of freedom,\" nineteen twenty-two.\n When I ran, it rained. The blackbirds settled\n their clannish squabbles in the reeds, and light came up.\n First darkening, then light. And then pure fire.\n Where does it come from? out of the impure\n shining that rises from the soaked odor of the grass,\n the levitating, Congregational, meadow-light-at-twilight\n light that darkens the heavy-headed blossoms\n of wild carrot, out of that, out of nothing\n it boils up, pools on the horizon, fissures up,\n igniting the undersides of clouds: pink flame,\n red flame, vermilion, purple, deeper purple, dark.\n You could wring the sourness of the sumac from the air,\n the fescue sweetness from the grass, the slightly\n maniacal cicadas tuning up to tear the fabric\n of the silence into tatters, so that night,\n if it wants to, comes as a beggar to the door\n at which, if you do not offer milk and barley\n to the maimed figure of the god, your well will foul,\n your crops will wither in the fields. In the eastern marches\n children know the story that the aspen quivers\n because it failed to hide the Virgin and the Child\n when Herod's hunters were abroad.

We were not put on earth,\n the old man said, he was hacking into the crust\n of a sourdough half loaf in his vehement, impatient way\n with an old horn-handled knife, to express ourselves.\n I knew he had seen whole cities leveled: also\n that there had been a time of shame for him, outskirts\n of a ruined town, half Baroque, half Greek Revival,\n pediments of Flora and Hygeia from a brief eighteenth-century\n health spa boom lying on the streets in broken chunks\n and dogs scavenging among them. His one act of courage\n then had been to drop pieces of bread or chocolate,\n as others did, where a fugitive family of Jews\n was rumored to be hiding. I never raised my voice,\n of course, none of us did. He sliced wedges of cheese\n after the bread, spooned out dollops of sour jam\n from some Hungarian plum, purple and faintly gingered.\n Every day the bits of half-mildewed, dry, hard--\n this is my invention--whitened chocolate, dropped furtively\n into rubble by the abandoned outbuilding of some suburban\n mechanic's shop--but I am sure he said chocolate--\n and it comforted no one. We talked in whispers.\n\"Someone is taking them.\" \"Yes,\" Janos said,\n \"But it might just be the dogs.\" He set the table.\n Shrugged. Janos was a friend from the university,\n who fled east to join a people's liberation army,\n died in Siberia somewhere. Some of us whispered 'art',\n he said. Some of us 'truth.' A debate with cut vocal chords.\n You have to understand that, for all we knew, the Germans\n would be there forever. And if not the Germans, the Russians.\n Well, you don't 'have to' understand anything, naturally.\n No one knew which way to jump. What we had was language,\n you see. Some said art, some said truth. Truth, of course,\n was death. Clattered the plates down on the table. No one,\n no one said 'self-expression.' Well, you had your own forms\n of indulgence. Didn't people in the forties say 'man'\n instead of 'the self?' I think I said. I thought 'the self'\n came in in 1949. He laughed. It's true. Man,\n we said, is the creature who is able to watch himself\n eat his own shit from fear. You know what that is?\n Melodrama. I tell you, there is no bottom to self-pity.\n\n This comes back to me on the mountainside. Butterflies--\n tiny blues with their two-dot wings like quotation marks\n or an abandoned pencil sketch of a face. They hover lightly\n over lupine blooms, whirr of insects in the three o'clock sun.\nWhat about being? I had asked him. Isn't language responsible\n to it, all of it, the texture of bread, the hairstyles\n of the girls you knew in high school, shoelaces, sunsets,\n the smell of tea? Ah, he said,  you've been talking to Milosz.\n To Czeslaw I say this: silence preceeds us. We are catching up.\n I think he was quoting Jabes whom he liked to read.\nOf course, here, gesturing out the window, pines, ragged green\n of a winter lawn, the bay, you can express what you like,\n enumerate the vegetation. And you! you have to, I'm afraid,\n since you don't excel at metaphor. A shrewd, quick glance\n to see how I have taken this thrust. You write well, clearly.\n You are an intelligent man. But--finger in the air--\nsilence is waiting. Milosz believes there is a Word\n at the end that explains. There is silence at the end,\n and it doesn't explain, it doesn't even ask. He spread chutney\n on his bread, meticulously, out to the corners. Something\n angry always in his unexpected fits of thoroughness\n I liked. The cheese. Then a lunging, wolfish bite.\nPut it this way, I give you, here, now, a magic key.\n What does it open? This key I give you, what exactly\n does it open? Anything, anything! But what? I found\n that what I thought about was the failure of my marriage,\n the three or four lost years just at the end and after.\nFor me there is no key, not even the sum total of our acts.\n But you are a poet. You pretend to make poems. And?\n\n She sat on the couch sobbing, her rib cage shaking\n from its accumulated abysses of grief and thick sorrow.\n I don't love you, she said. The terrible thing is\n that I don't think I ever loved you. He thought to himself\n fast, to numb it, that she didn't mean it, thought\n what he had done to provoke it. It was May.\n Also pines, lawn, the bay, a blossoming apricot.\n Everyone their own devastation. Each on its own scale.\n I don't know what the key opens. I know we die,\n and don't know what is at the end. We don't behave well.\n And there are monsters out there, and millions of others\n to carry out their orders. We live half our lives\n in fantasy, and words. This morning I am pretending\n to be walking down the mountain in the heat.\n A vault of blue sky, traildust, the sweet medicinal\n scent of mountain grasses, and at trailside--\n I'm a little ashamed that I want to end this poem\n singing, but I want to end this poem singing--the wooly\n closed-down buds of the sunflower to which, in English,\n someone gave the name, sometime, of pearly everlasting.",

In the dark, I can see\n her black hair, black against the pillows. Its clean\n scent makes me think of corn. At dawn, I hold her\n and there are kisses. Then more kisses. Then more.\n The day is cold; a north wind blew last night. But\n the land is open. Rain falls in showers of light.\n  \n 6\n Her hand on my thigh, my shoulder,\n in my hair. She leans over to kiss my cheek.\n We look at each other, smile. For miles\n we travel this way, nearly silent, point\n with eyes or chins at the circling hawk, the king-\n fisher on the snag above the swollen\n creek. One night I weep in her arms\n as she cries, \"Oh, oh, oh!\" because I have touched\n her scars lightly: throat, belly, breasts.\n In that communion of lovers, thick sobs\n break from me as I think of my love\n back home, all that I have done\n and cannot say. This is the first time\n I have left her so completely, so alone.",
        "Flu, 1962": "Shadows lengthened while we sat stuck in traffic just beyond San Rafael. Headlights had begun to flare in the cool dusk. The hum of the car's engine lulled me, and I put my forehead against the glass, looking out over a darkening landscape. We were headed to the Bishop's Ranch, a weekend retreat for Episcopal Young Churchmen in hilly country that would someday produce superlative wines with garnet hues that stain the inside of a glass. I was queasy from the lurching of the car, the stops and starts, the smell of exhaust. Though trembling with cold, I was too shy to ask the lady, the mother of one of the other girls, to turn on the heater. I imagined pale pink blossoms on the Japanese plum, apple trees laden with white flowers, and north of Sebastapol the vibrant yellow of daffodils on slender, pleated stems. That night I slept in a single bunk made up with thin sheets and blankets.\n \nA warm sun the next day restored me, but in the evening, seated by the fire that crackled in the fireplace of the big lodge, I felt flushed. Our recently ordained curate (we were not to know he was gay till some years later) had asked me to bring my guitar, and now he wanted me to sing about the girl who decides to sleep next to her mother her whole life long instead of falling for an unfaithful suitor. I sang; we all sang together. Young Father W. had a wonderful tenor voice. His smile reassured me, but now I was tired and, earlier than the others, I decided to return to the dorm.\n \nIn that clear March night, the sky gleamed like black ink and stars blazed, bright and alive. Walking downhill, guitar in hand, I suddenly stumbled with dizziness, and the slope swam before me. \"Hold on, hold on,\" I told myself as I nearly fell onto the dew-slick lawn. For a moment I could sense myself floating away from my body. Back in the dorm, I crawled into bed and lay shuddering with cold, bones aching. The room seemed to spin. I wanted to be home, but the thought of facing my mother filled me with terrible dismay. I knew the blue failure notice mailed by the school would have arrived.\n \nSure enough, it lay open on the dining table when I got home the following afternoon. A Sunday fog, hardly a mist, had blown in from the bay and was gathering in the eucalyptus across the ravine. The house was steamy. A basket of clean laundry occupied a chair atop a stack of San Francisco Chronicles. Mom sat at the table sewing, but I knew she was scowling. I thought it wise to look industrious, so I began to fold towels and pillowcases. \"What I want to know,\" began my mother, \"is whether you have any ambition? Obviously, you will never get to college. What do you expect to do with your life?\" She paused, and I shrugged. \"Go ahead and shrug. Do you think your girlfriend is going to take care of you? That won't last long. And why is it you only fall in love with girls? Well, I suppose you want to be a boy.\" What an unutterable failure I am. I retreated, burned by her ferocious, upright anger. \"Oh, yes, I'm sure you're sick! But you will go to school tomorrow!\"\n \nThat night, wracked again with cold, unable to stop my trembling, I sought my parents' bed, stood moaning till Mom woke and let me under the covers, where she tried to warm me with her body. Weeks later we learned that one of my classmates, a robust girl who shot baskets as well as any boy, had succumbed to the illness and died. That night, my mother placed her hand on my forehead-her smooth palm, her touch, gentle-and said to my barely awake dad, \"Our daughter has a raging fever.\" Like a miracle, I was still her child. Comforted, I slept."

        "The Holy Twins": "Ours was a play-filled childhood; irrigation ditches ran deep\n during the summers. We played in the water and dirt, then inscribed\n ABCs and numbers onto the smooth ground. Our cat Polly died\n of rabies; then all the pets had to be shot, some in the rib cage\n as they thrashed in panic. There was a pink bruise\n on my forehead from pressing against the wall. We couldn't figure\n  \n out how such a thing could happen. The dogs were steadfast figures\n around the farm. They chased strange cars and sometimes invoked deep\n panic among visitors and passersby. They had cuts and bruises\n from scuffles with roaming packs. No tags were inscribed\n with their random Navajo names. Snazzy was skinny; his rib cage\n obvious through thin fur. He looked as if he might die\n  \n from hunger, but he ate like nobody's business. Who knew he would die\n of rabies with the rest? The main thing was to figure\n out how they contracted it, my parents said. We cried until our rib cages\n ached; our eyes stayed swollen. This first loss was too deep\n to even talk about. Decades later, I can finally describe\n how that summer led us into a grief that felt like a bruise\n  \n that would last forever. But our neighbor suffered worse bruises:\n their huge dog, named Dog, was the first to die\n and was the cause of all this. Their home and fields are inscribed\n in our memories as \"the rabies place.\" Over time, they must have figured\n it was too much to live down. Childhood losses run deep,\n even though we are grandparents now. The memory is an invisible cage\n  \n of anguished sobs, gunshots, yelping howls, canine rib cages\n exploding. Sometimes we reminisce and notice that the bruises\n of grief have turned pale like smoothed-over scars. That initial deep\n hurt was the start, we found, of how love could die\n right before us, even as we watched: stunned figures\n pleading for mercy, urgent prayers saying, \"Let God's scribe\n  \n mark this down. We've paid our dues. Our hearts are inscribed\n with loss after loss.\" For some reason, after everything, our rib cages\n held up and continued to cradle tender hearts. They must have figured\n that all the prayers and careful teachings would prevent bruises\n that would weaken us. Our love for those homely animals was deep\n  \n and would figure in the knowledge that such bruises\n aren't endless, and that our rib cages are not mere bones. One can die\n from grief, so now we can describe loss and love as the Holy Twins.",

My granddaughters hovered near me\n as if I might faint or fall unexpectedly.\n  \n Did you see, Sister, the way the grandchildren fed and served everyone?\n They guided the grandparents and the elderly to their chairs.\n Once seated, they served plates filled with mutton ribs,\n potato salad, corn, thick slabs of oven bread, crispy fry bread,\n and Jell-O salad. They placed the salt and pepper--that enduring couple--\n before us and implored us to eat. The two delights we relished were good--\n hot, strong coffee and cold, crisp diet pop.\n  \n We ate for you; we consumed your meal, Shideezhi.\n We ate to honor the times you cooked for us--\n those tasty dishes, scrumptious pastries combined with laughter,\n silly childhood memories, and always teasing jokes.\n Sister, I didn't know how we would make it;\n it is still too much to think of you not being here."

        "Mighty Forms": "The earth had wanted us all to itself.\n The mountains wanted us back for themselves.\n The numbered valleys of serpentine wanted us;\n that's why it happened as it did, the split\n as if one slow gear turned beneath us. . .\n Then the Tuesday shoppers paused in the street\n and the tube that held the trout-colored train\n and the cords of action from triangular buildings\n and the terraced gardens that held camelias\n shook and shook, each flower a single thought.\n\n Mothers and children took cover under tables.\n I called out to her who was my life.\n From under the table--I hid under the table\n that held the begonia with the fiery stem,\n the stem that had been trying to root, that paused\n in its effort--I called to the child who was my life.\n And understood, in the endless instant\n before she answered, how Pharaoh's army, seeing\n the ground break open, seeing the first fringed\n horses fall into the gap, made their vows,\n that each heart changes, faced with a single awe\n and in that moment a promise is written out.\n\n However we remember California later\n the earth we loved will know the truth:\n that it wanted us back for itself\n with our mighty forms and our specific longings,\n wanted them to be air and fire but they wouldn't;\n the kestrel circled over a pine, which lasted,\n the towhee who loved freedom, gathering seed\n during the shaking lasted, the painting released\n by the wall, the mark and hook we placed\n on the wall, and the nail, and the memory\n of driving the nail in, these also lasted--",
        "Food": "In a side booth at MacDonald's before your music class\n you go up and down in your seat like an arpeggio\n under the poster of the talking hamburger:\n two white eyes rolling around in the top bun, the thin\n patty of beef imitating the tongue of its animal nature.\n You eat merrily. I watch the Oakland mommies,\n trying to understand what it means to be \"single.\"\n\n *\n\n Across from us, females of all ages surround the birthday girl.\n Her pale lace and insufficient being\n can't keep them out of her circle.\n Stripes of yellow and brown all over the place.\n The poor in spirit have started to arrive,\n the one with thick midwestern braids twisted like thought\n on her head; usually she brings her mother.\n This week, no mother. She mouths her words anyway\n across the table, space-mama, time-mama,\n mama who should be there.\n\n *\n\n Families in line: imagine all this\n translated by the cry of time moving through us,\n this place a rubble. The gardens new generations\n will plant in this spot, and the food will go on\n in another order. This thought cheers me immensely.\n That we will be there together, you still seven,\n bending over the crops pretending to be royalty,\n that the huge woman with one blind eye\n and dots like eyes all over her dress\n will also be there, eating with pleasure\n as she eats now, right up to the tissue paper,\n peeling it back like bright exotic petals.\n\n *\n\n Last year, on the sun-spilled deck in Marin\n we ate grapes with the Russians;\n the KGB man fingered them quickly and dutifully,\n then, in a sad tone to us\n \"We must not eat them so fast,\n we wait in line so long for these,\" he said.\n\n *\n\n The sight of food going into a woman's mouth\n made Byron sick. Food is a metaphor for existence.\n When Mr. Egotistical Sublime, eating the pasta,\n poked one finger into his mouth, he made a sound.\n For some, the curve of the bell pepper\n seems sensual but it can worry you,\n the slightly greasy feel of it.\n\n *\n\n The place I went with your father had an apartment to the left, and in the window, twisted like a huge bowtie,\n an old print bedspread. One day, when I looked over,\n someone was watching us, a young girl.\n The waiter had just brought the first thing:\n an orange with an avocado sliced up CCCC\n in an oil of forceful herbs. I couldn't eat it.\n The girl's face stood for something\n and from it, a little mindless daylight was reflected.\n The businessmen at the next table\n were getting off on each other and the young chardonnay.\n Their briefcases leaned against their ankles.\n I watched the young girl's face because for an instant\n I had seen your face there,\n unterrified, unhungry, and a little disdainful.\n Then the waiter brought the food,\n bands of black seared into it like the memory of a cage.\n\n *\n\n You smile over your burger, chattering brightly.\n So often, at our sunny kitchen table,\n hearing the mantra of the refrigerator,\n I've thought there was nothing I could do but feed you;\n and I've always loved the way you eat,\n you eat selfishly, humming, bending\n the french fries to your will, your brown eyes\n spotting everything: the tall boy\n who has come in with his mother, repressed rage\n in espadrilles, and now carries the tray for her.\n Oh this is fun, says the mother,\n You stand there with mommy's purse.\n And he stands there smiling after her,\n holding all the patience in the world.",
        "Recycling Center": "The labeled bins on the California hillside\n catch the glint and quarter-glint of passing cars.\n Families pull up with their interesting trash\n and start unloading: Here, sweetheart,\n this goes over in Newspaper. The bundle\n hits with a thud. Diet soda cans\n spin almost noiselessly down, and the sun-\n permitting bottles from a day's pleasure\n are tossed into Mixed Glass by the children\n who like to hear the smash, unknowable, chaotic,\n as matter greets itself and starts to change.\n\n What mystery is inside a thing! If we peered\n into the bin, we could see it waiting there,\n could believe everything is alive and specific\n and personal, could tell by the tilt of one\n bottle against the next that it's difficult\n to be singular, to have identity, to keep\n an outline safe in the terrors of space.\n Even the child knows this. Bye, bottle! she shouts,\n tossing it in; and the bottle lies there\n in the two o'clock position, temporarily itself,\n before being swept into the destiny of mixture. . .\n\n And what if some don't want to. What if some items\n in the piles of paper, the orange and blue\n envelopes from a magazine sweepstakes, numbers\n pressing through the cloudy windows\n with our names, some among those pale sheets curled\n with moisture, would rather stay as they are.\n It's spring; we've thrown away mistakes--\n tax forms, recipes, tennis-ball-sized\n drafts of poems--that which was blank\n shall be made blank again--but what if\n that failed letter wants to be a failure,\n not go back to pulp, and thought .. .\n Or across the parking lot, where light insists\n on changing the dull cans, a few cans don't want\n to be changed, though they should want to,\n shouldn't they, should want to be changed\n by light, light which is called sweet reason,\n honeyed, spectra, magnitude, light that goes\n from the parking lot looking helpless\n though it is matter that has been betrayed. . .\n\n All afternoon the bins are carried off\n by those who know about where things should go,\n who are used to the clatter the cans make,\n pouring out; and the families, who believed change\n would heal them are pulling away in their vans,\n slightly embarrassed by that which refused . . .\n The bins fill again with hard substances,\n the hills bear down with their fugitive gold,\n the pampas grass bending low to protect\n what was briefly certain and alive with hope.",
        "Several Errands": "The shoe repairman works behind the married shoes,\n his whole hand inside the boot he's shining,\n everything cozy in the glass displays, laces paired\n on gravel he's spread out in the window, shoes\n placed as though they're walking, and beside them\n propped up, the wooden tongues of shoe horns, poised\n to serve the inanimate world ... He comes out mildly\n attentive, soft accent, possibly a Scottish\n childhood, possibly sheep to tend ... Clear day,\n first summer divorced in Berkeley, a time of seamless, indescribable grief; he waits kindly in his blue apron,\n fingering the well-worn inner sole, and I am grateful\n for those who serve us knowing nothing of our lives ...\n\n *\n\n The cleaner waits behind the silver bell;\n he's from Cambodia and has free Christian literature\n on the counter. He greets me with pleasant chatter,\n searches through the coats, some left for years,\n he says; they make a soft blue whistle as they circulate\n on the ovals like the ones under those automatic boats.\n As the clothes pass, little checks and prints under\n the whooshing of motion, I see my husband's coat--\n how long will I call him my husband--like an old friend\n passing by quickly not bothering to greet me. Odd now,\n I don't have to pick it up, the serious plaid will go\n around between the women's suits and stay all night. . .\n\n *\n\n I watch the young butcher flipping over the young\n chicken: he takes one wing and sort of spins it,\n first on its back, flinging the trimmed, watery\n lemon-colored fat into the trash, then before\n he starts on the legs he puts his hand so deeply in\n that the finger comes out the neck ... The other butcher\n sets the slab of beef under the saw: the riveting\n intricate swirl as the dead flesh pulls away;\n he goes off, shouts short words from the deep freeze--\n to me or to the carcass hanging by the shank?--\n I can wait, but the spaces can't, there's a slight\n ticking, then the carcass swings and swings ...\n Somehow I thought we would know everything\n through the flesh. Perhaps. But my days have become\n spirit. The young butcher splits the chicken\n down the back, seems to enjoy the crack of the knife\n as it enters the bone, so I try to. Housewives lean\n against the cool glass to convey holiday news and he\n responds without really looking up; I love that.\n\n *\n\n oh Berkeley summer mornings, aren't they--\n what? past the French Hotel, the glint of tiny spoons\n so briefly and soberly allowed to rest on white saucers,\n the plums just about over, the agapanthus--\"lilies of denial\"--\n in the center dividers, blooming, or just about to--\n like me, hearty and hesitant, not wanting to write it,\n not wanting to ruin the perfection of the poem\n by writing it . . . At the dentist, the little mirror,\n the dinosaur prong is put into the mouth. Mouth:\n the first darkness. Nearby: the mobile with straw\n eyeless fishes. The dentist will go home to her family,\n having briefly reached inside the visible mystery\n and found nothing ... I imagine Wisdom in the text\n is like this, creating the cosmos from the mind of God,\n looking interested and competent; she touches\n the physical place with her prong, and the pain shines ...\n\n (--a man told me I better think\n about my 'system.'\n Oh dear!

But instead\n of gaudy stripes, your box is sober-suit blue, hymnal blue.\n  \n Tasted them. You've gained a statue's flavor, like licking the pyramids, or\n kissing sandstone shoulders. I mean boulders.\n  \n Remarked to your box: \"REINCARNATION comes from roots meaning 'to\n be made flesh again.'\"\n  \n Stowed your box under my bed for a week to seed dreams in which you\n advise me. (This didn't work.)\n  \n Opened the Babylonian Talmud at random. Read aloud to your gritty,\n gray-white powder: \"There are three keys which the Holy One, blessed be\n He, has not entrusted into the hands of any messenger. These are: the key\n of rain, the key of birth, and the key of the resurrection of the dead.\"\n Worked myself up to watery eyes. Any intensity evaporated the instant I\n stopped reading.\n  \n Tried to intuit your format, sift it from tides of void. Does shape play a\n role? My watch ticked in an exaggerated way. Closed my eyes, sent forth\n mental tendrils seeking the nothing of you.

The forest opens and closes, a door loose on its hinges, banging in a strong wind. Everything in the dim kitchen: the basin, the jug, the skillet, the churn, snickers scornfully. In this way a maiden is driven toward the dangers of a forest, but the forest is our subject, not this young girl.She's glad to lie down with trees towering all around.A certain euphoria sets in. She feels molecular, bedeviled, senses someone gently pulling her hair, tingles with kisses she won't receive for years. Three felled trees, a sort of chorus, narrate her thoughts, or rather channel theirs through her, or rather subject her to their peculiar verbal restlessness ...    our deepening need for non-being intones the largest and most decayed tree, mid-sentence. I'm not one of you squeaks the shattered sapling,blackened by lightning. Their words become metallic spangles shivering the air. Will I forget the way home?the third blurts. Why do I feel like I'm hiding in a giant's nostril?the oldest prone pine wants to know. Are we being   freed from matter? the sapling asks. Insects are well-intentioned, offers the third tree, by way of consolation. Will it growimpossible to think a thought through to its end? gasps the sapling, adding in a panicky voice, I'm becoming spongy! The girl feels her hands attach to some distant body. She rises to leave, relieved these trees are not talking about her.",

To pin one's hopes on a bark-colored moth, its wings crinkled like crepe paper, a moth affixed high on the kitchen wall, frozen for days where it will likely die in noble clinging modejust under the cobwebby heating vent, is to confirm your need for more friends and a greater daily quota of sunlight. To raise C.'s hopes that T. can stop drinking and then to liken those hopes to fields of undulating grain, alfalfa perhaps, is to wish C. hip deep in acres of unscythed denial. The blind typist hopes she'll be hired tonight without her disability becoming an issue. L. said he felt hope's rhizomes race throughout his body, radiating in all directions, like some incipient disease he'd been fighting since childhood. Hope, he said, it's as insidious as bitterness. If mother earth only knew how much we loved one another she would creak, shudder, and split like a macheted melon, releasing the fiery ball of molten hope at her core.",

How they suffer\n for our sins, \"splintered, bursted, crumbled . . .\"\n Every bed in the head replacement ward is occupied tonight.\n Let's sit by the legless Queen doll's tiny wheelchair\n and read to her awhile if she wishes it.

        "Poem for Bernard": "\"It is in the power of every hand to destroy us, and we are beholden unto everyone we meet, he doth not kill us.\" --Sir Thomas Browne \n\n\n\nWe're down here in the basement\n dodging bombs. As our loves\n freckle with age we must adore\n them more ferociously. Come winter\n you kick back and ready your weapons\n\n for spring. My next task was to get well.\n Five million years ago, there were different\n terrors. Saber toothed fears. Edgar Allen Poe\n was terrified of being buried alive. Fear\n is a civilising influence. It keeps us in line.\n\n Fear of bacteria. Of our own murderous\n kind. Of aliens superior to us in every\n way who'll arrive any moment\n and sensibly decide to clean house.\n A terrible cry arises from the thick\n\n of things. My begging bowl\n runneth over. Heaven has been\n relocated and we're not telling you\n where. Not even a hint. I don't love\n you anymore. What might it mean\n\n to die a worthy death\n and how much should one brood\n about that ahead of time?\n I was just trying to get back\n to the boat alive. Let us lurch forward\n\n or hellward. What an adorable form\n of anarchy when the body outwits us.\n I am a heretic in their eyes, so they\n will kill us both and murder your children\n if they find our hiding place. Despite\n\n everything, I awoke full of praise\n for you, as I do each morning.\n Coughing constantly, I rinsed\n my hands and ate some seeded crackers.\n I thought about your face and prayed."

Sometimes a man who spoke\n in tongues and leapt for joy would break into\n an avalanche of cursing that would stun\n with brilliance and duration. Those that heard\n would say the holy spirit spoke as from\n a whirlwind. Words burned on the air like chains\n of dynamite.

        "Mountain Dulcimer": "Where does such sadness in wood come\n from? How could longing live in these\n wires? The box looks like the most fragile\n coffin tuned for sound. And laid\n across the knees of this woman\n it looks less like a baby nursed\n than some symbolic Pieta,\n and the stretched body on her lap\n yields modalities of lament\n and blood, yields sacrifice and sliding\n chants of grief that dance and dance toward\n a new measure, a new threshold,\n a new instant and new year which\n we always celebrate by\n remembering the old and by\n recalling the lost and honoring\n those no longer here to strike these\n strings like secrets of the most\n satisfying harmonies, as\n voices join in sadness and joy\n and tell again what we already\n know, have always known but forget,\n from way back in the farthest cove,\n from highest on the peaks of love."

Only tall faceless figures\n of pain flutter across the bridge. They pace in charred suits,\n the hands lift, point and ache and fly at sunset as cold dark\n birds. They will hover over the dead ones: a family shattered\n by military, buried by hunger, asleep now with the eyes burning\n echoes calling Joaquin, Maria, Andrea, Joaquin, Joaquin, Andrea\n\nen exilio\n\n From here we see them, we the ones from here, not there or across,\n only here, without the bridge, without the arms as blue liquid\n quenching the secret thirst of unmarked graves, without\n our flesh journeying refuge or pilgrimage; not passengers\n on imaginary ships sailing between reef and sky, we that die\n here awake on Harrison Street, on Excelsior Avenue clutching\n the tenderness of chrome radios, whispering to the saints\n in supermarkets, motionless in the chasm of playgrounds,\n searching at 9 a.m. from our third floor cells, bowing mute,\n shoving the curtains with trembling speckled brown hands.

But she won't.   \n She won't go back to the home of twenty years and her father who pretends   \n to play Santa by Agustin Lara on his old guitar and the mother organizing a   \n Jehovah's Witnesses' meeting. Estela will leave the car parked between   \n Harrison Street and Alabama in San Francisco. She'll walk aimlessly in the   \n warmth of the produce stores, into St. Peter's church, by the Galeria de la   \n Raza, China Books, the bakery at La Victoria. She'll walk in the night with   \n her eyes burning, seeing him laughing, the young man in his black box   \n apartment, laughing, laughing, laughing like a little man.\n\n The little man laughs. It's an apartment of marriage and fists. The   \n wife-beater laughs in his easy chair. Next to his bed he sees the anxious   \n note. He focuses on the signature with the E broken in three places.\n\n He looks at the stained and unmade sheets, the dull curtains, the crushed   \n cigarettes and the ashes. The black-and-white television announces a sale   \n of living room furniture. With his can of beer he observes. Smokes. Thinks.\n\n Within a week or two they'll take his cousin to San Quentin prison, again.   \n The last time he saw him he was a gardener at a college.\n\n He imagines Estela coming home.

Weakness   \n consumes him night after night. He can't speak, tires easily. But he can   \n hear. He hears the white heels of the doctors and nurses running to the   \n rooms of the dying. He hears footsteps fluttering like doves over the floor   \n or like the leaves of fever falling from the roof of hell.\n\n It's eleven o'clock at night. He hears the abandoned man in room 200 fall   \n out of bed attempting to drink a glass of water.

An orderly. He cleans his   \n body with a warm sponge. His hands run slowly down the yellowed back,   \n the belly and fragile shoulders of Randi. Dark birds fly over a forgotten   \n landscape. Randi looks at his mother rubbing his chest with alcohol to   \n quiet the cough before he sleeps. He turns his face. Imagines his one-room   \n house, a trailer his father made out of an old car.

From afar you can see birds crossing above the saguaros and   \n the sky.\n\n The last time I saw Randi was at San Francisco City College. He had just   \n turned in all his papers so he could drop out at midterm. He didn't want to   \n go on with it. It was a farce.\n\n Like when he was invited to read poetry near the Galeria de La Raza in the   \n Mission District. He never showed up.

I want\n\n the Titian ochre yeast of winter, keyboard man, fix your eyes\n on my eyes and tell me, handsome, how long will I live?\n\n How many double-fisted desires, crushed letters, will I lift\n in this terrain? And this rumbling sleeve, this ironed flint\n\n of inquisitions and imaginary executors, where shall I strike,\n what proud stones? Will this fauna open for me, ever, this fuzz,\n\n anointed beak inside the bartender's mirrors, etched doves,\n a cautious spiral Harley tank, hissing, this Indian bead choker on Rita's neck?\n\n How long shall we remain as wavy reflections,\n imitators of our own jacket's frown? Who shall awaken first?\n\n Margo Fitzer, the waitress? I will say, Queen Margo, sing to me\n stoic princess of slavering hearts, three faint lines creased\n\n on your satin belly, toss our planet onto your umber lacquer tray,\n too empty now; make the earth spin its dog rhapsody, erotic\n\n through this silvery off-ramp and flake, unfurl. We tumble across\n this raceway in honey-glazed traces, our arms ahead, the hands\n\n flying to Ricky's Ice Cream Parlour, outside. I want to own one\n someday, maybe on Thirty-Second Street. You will see me\n\n in my gelled waved hair, my busy wrists--so fast, a clown's\n resolute gloves, dipping faster than finger painting--except   \n\n I'd be stirring milk and the chocolate foam of love, churning,\n burning this sweet spirit, more uncertain, than the celestial\n\n sheaths above the prairie frost. See the boy coming, they chide,\n leaning, how he crosses his legs, his eyes dreaming, sideburns\n\n just shaved clean. He weighs the sour slate on his father's breath;\n perfume, fortune, cards left on the bleeding table. Milo Wilkens, drummer\n\n at the curve, strokes his nipples with his arms as he hits the high hat.\n Somewhere in the back rooms, I know, a shrine, orange sponge cushions,\n\n two toilets and a wire wound wicker box, to leave flowers, occasional\n offerings by the Johnson County dudes, detasselers in jersey ties.\n\n Talk no more, enjoy. Darling singer, let your starry blouse sway me,\n steal this fresh peach half from its amber juice; I want the moon\n\n in this nectar, too. The flashing cymbals, feverish. Who can strike\n a votive candle, love, or sleep in this electronic night? Just listen\n\n to the two-part harmony, laughter, peeling beyond the cemetery, beyond\n the Iowa river--where the spike hat rooster bristles his tiny ears,\n\n bows his head, and sips from the dark canister under the carved pearl-stone.\n And then, returns. Let us drink, salute the bright spokes of meal, the dying\n\n wands of river blossoms, grandmother's sacred hair; listen, her soprano\n owl, her bluish melody, so thin. Another glass please, we shall dance\n\n once again, our eyebrows smearing against each other's cheekbones, loud\n with a Midwest sweat, a cantata from the crosshatch amp, click it.\n\n Click it, for wild kind rain, forgiving seasons, for the blushed bread\n of our shoulders and thighs, this night, everyone is here. Even Jeff Yoder\n\n came all the way from Illinois, to fill a bucket with passion, ruffled,\n thick. O sax player with a jail needle tattoo, leap onto this wet pavement,\n\n call my lonesome tempest heart, its buried mother's kiss, bless us\n in staccato, with quivers of oak branch greenness, and sparrow longings\n\n riff over this brutal sky, give us your bell filled, conjure your tropic,\n our lover's breath. Blues bar dancers, jangling gold popcorn, chord makers,\n\n opal-eyed Suzie in a flannel shirt; we beckon the spark, the flaring\n this lost body to live."

I was glad to hear the black robes had given you this shimmer of elongated nights, left to waver in the void. They know how to die in battle. They are a twist in the black mirror, that river between the city and the mist. We will produce no sane men again. They come back different and the same. They roam over hills and plains and wish the heavens would fall. You issued the first soldiers and we only answered back, seeking air. I have sent many words that were drowned along the way.

I drop my bag on home plate \nand swirl my foot in the dust the way my cousin does \nwith his fingers on the skin of a drum head. Next year\n\nhe'll be released with the others who spent mornings \nbreaking windows and trashing vacation homes \nlike drunks in the right field bleachers. Here, I'm alone \nwith a sparrow and the smell of a baseball morning\n\nsettling around me like a comforter. I start trotting \nto first base, the ankles loosening, then the knees, \nas the dust begins to lift into the breaking light. \nAround second and third I stretch my arms\n\nin a rotary motion ready to fly. A hand waves back \nfrom a passing car, someone who knows me \nor remembers rising one morning when the game \nof who you are is played out in your mind,\n\nand around you a stadium full of fans begs you\nto do what you usually do in the clutch. The bat I pull\nfrom the bag for the first time is my father's \nLouisville Slugger, thirty-three inches, wood barrel.\n\nI thought enough time had passed, the attic dust \nhard in the grooves. I stroke it slowly like a weapon\nyou love to touch but would never use. He hit .304\nat Omaha the season he was drafted, all-star\n\nrookie-of-the-year. He said we'd join him soon.\nThen that other draft. He would have been here.\nI swear he would. The silence feels oppressive now.\nI dig for a scuffed ball and throw it up, shoulder high,\n\nbut let it fall. A natural hitter, my father said, holding\nmy hands. I grip the tar-stained handle. Tears blur\nthe wall that's so far away it looks warped. I aim\nfor marrow deep inside, April hungry for the kill.",

I know that morality, \npenance, a kind heart don't matter, nor the faith \nI embraced or didn't, the people I saved. I know \nthe key is where I land on the scale of commitment.\n\nEarnhardt, Sr., died for the game, and got in. \nMany ancient Egyptians buried juggling balls \nwith them, as though endless practice and craft \nwere their gifts to the next world. They entered. \nI ask if I can peek in, maybe stand on the edge \nand look into the vast canyon of pits, arenas, \nfields, fairways, pools, rings, tables, tracks, \ncourts, beaches, forests, mountains\n\nwhere war is forbidden. Here is what I bring \nfor review: a nasty fastball, a runner-up ring, \nindividual initiative, a contrary attitude, the heart \nof a poet. I bring a willingness to run like an outlaw, \nhonor the Greeks and Makahiki, invent new games, \npractice past dusk, play on the second squad, \nand keep score until I can get in the game \nwith eternity left on the clock.

        "Something in the Belly": "I wanted to have a poem and I was pregnant. I was very thin. As if I'd lived on air. A poet must be able to live on air, but a mother must not attempt it. My mother wanted me to buy a set of matching pots, Wearever aluminum, like the ones she had. They were heavy and had well fitting lids so my suppers wouldn't burn. My husband wanted me to give dinner parties. John F. Kennedy was running for office.\n \nI sensed danger. Kennedy wasn't against the Bomb or for nuclear disarmament. I joined SANE at its inception. Also Concerned Scientists. I spoke with Linus Pauling and encouraged my husband to help his partner organize Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n \nThere was a baby in my belly. I wanted to write poems. I had a crazy idea that a woman could write a real novel, the kind that shook the world. I hallucinated that a woman could be a poet, but she would have to be free. I couldn't imagine that freedom for myself even though I could see it in Isla Negra when I followed Pablo Neruda. I could see it in the way he walked. Even if he were walking inside a dictatorship, among guns, soldiers and spies, there was nothing between him and his vision. Anything he saw, he was able to take into himself-there was no sight, no image, no vision to which he didn't feel entitled. In his heart, everything-everything-belonged to him. Pablo Neruda was-more than anything-a poet, and so he was an entitled man.\n \nI was a woman and entitled to nothing. I had nothing except a husband, a rented house, a set of pots, living room furniture, a frenzy of obligations, credit cards, anxious relatives, too many acquaintances, a gift of future diaper service, two telephones, no time to read, a plastic wrapped cookbook of recipes gleaned from the pages of the New York Times, and a hunger, a terrible hunger for the unimaginable, unlimited freedom of being a poet, and a baby in my belly.\n \nI would have called Pablo long distance if I had the courage, if I had the ability to speak Spanish fluently, if we had ever talked about real things. But, what would a man know about a baby in the belly? And what did it matter if there were to be one poet more or less in the world when so many in his country were dying?\n \nI woke up one morning and thought-I can't have this child. My husband said, \"You'll have to get a job after it's born so we can buy a house. You'll need an advanced degree so you can do something.\" I thought, I can't. I have to write poems. My mother found a crib. Someone painted it white. A friend sent a pastel mobile with tame wood animals. I thought about blue curtains, making bedspreads, and abortions.\n \nPablo was silent. He was walking so far from me, I couldn't hear him. My husband objected to donating more free medical care to the Black Panthers. I tried to make dolmades from scratch and located grape leaves preserved in brine at the Boys' Market twenty miles away. I organized a write-in campaign for peace to challenge JFK. My husband thought it would be nice to have teatime with the children and romantic dinners by ourselves. The new formula bottles lined up on the sink like tiny bombs. The U.S. was pursuing over ground testing; I was afraid the radiation would cross the milk barrier. I had a poem in me howling for real life but no language to write in. The fog came in thick, flapping about my feet like blankets unraveling. I became afraid to have a daughter.\n \nI called Pablo Neruda in the middle of the night as he walked underwater by Isla Negra. He moved like a dream porpoise. He seemed pregnant with words. They came out of his penis in long miraculous strings. The sea creatures quivered with joy. I said, \"Pablo, I want to know how to bear the child in my belly onto this bed of uranium and I want to know if a woman can a be a poet.\" He was large as a whale. He drank the sea and spouted it in glistening odes, black and shiny. I said, \"I can't have this child,\" and he laughed as if he had never done anything but carry and birth children.\n \nSo I packed my little bag as if I were going to the hospital and I left a note and the Wearever pots and sterilized nipples upon the glass missiles, and took the cradle board that an American Indian friend had given me for the baby and that had made my husband snort- \"You're not going to carry the thing on your back, are you?\" I took some money, the car, some books, paper and pens, my walking shoes, an unwieldly IBM electric typewriter, my pregnant belly and a dozen cloth diapers, and I went out.\n \nI knew how to carry a baby and how to carry a poem and I would learn how to have a baby and even how to have a poem. I would have enough milk for both. I would learn how to walk with them. But I didn't know, and I didn't want to know, how to have a husband and a matched set of Wearever pots.",

As a last resort, she'll even read out loud the entries from her diary about him to him. But eventually he'll become convinced she's hiding things from him and she is. Her perfect skin. Her long black hair. Her red mouth, never chapped from exposure to sun or wind, how she secretly loves that he can't touch her here or here.",
        "My Wolf Sister": "When my hole-punch drizzles tiny paper circles onto the carpet, my wolf sister moans and bites it, covering her ears with her paws. I think she's tired of the moon. She takes a stack of dinner plates from my cupboard and slinks off to the park to break them. Our brother shows up a week later, collapses on the sofa like a fur throw. Why have they come here when everything I do is wrong? They howl in the shower together but the water doesn't mask the sound. I go in afterwards with paper towels to mop the droplets-I know there'll be water all over-but the room is bone dry. Maybe this time things will be different. I hide the home movies in case they ask for them. In the one I always watch, there's some wobbly footage of the sky, then my father lowers the camera's eye to mother teaching my sister and brother to \"tell time.\" They're following a mother hare on her sunset rounds-one leveret mouthful at 12 o'clock, another at 3, 6, 9. Then the camera zooms in on me-I've spat out my pacifier made of fur and I'm on the porch surrounded by bonsai trees, killing or saving Barbie.",
        "Wac-A-Mole Realism(tm)": "At the carnival, Robo-Boy sees only things he recognizes. The Ferris Wheel is an overgrown version of his own bells and whistle eyes. His Flashers, his mother calls them. The Tilt-A-Whirl is the angle his head tilts when the Flirt Program goes into effect, usually in the vicinity of a Cindy or a Carrie, though once he found himself tilting at the school librarian which caused him to wheel in reverse into the Civil War section knocking over a cart of books that were waiting to be shelved under B. There's a dangerously low stratosphere of pink cotton-candy clouds being carried around by the children. If Robo-Boy goes near them, the alarms will go off. It's the kind of sticky that would cause joint-lock for sure. In a darker, safer corner Robo-Boy finds the Whack-A-Mole game. He pays a dollar and starts whacking the plastic moles on their heads each time they pop up from the much-dented log. He wins bear after bear. It's only when he's lugging them home, the largest one skidding face-down along the sidewalk getting dirt on its white nose and light blue belly, that he remembers the program: Wac-A-Mole Realism(tm)--the disc on the installer's desk. Suddenly it all fits together: the way a deliciously strange thought will start wafting out of his unconscious--and then WHAM, it disappears.",
        "Shiver & You Have Weather": "In the aftermath of calculus\n your toast fell butter-side down.\n\n Squirrels swarmed the lawns\n in flight patterns. The hovercraft\n\n helped the waves along.

        "The Crowds Cheered as Gloom Galloped Away": "Everyone was happier. But where did the sadness go? People wanted to know. They didn't want it collecting in their elbows or knees then popping up later. The girl who thought of the ponies made a lot of money. Now a month's supply of pills came in a hard blue case with a handle. You opened it & found the usual vial plus six tiny ponies of assorted shapes & sizes, softly breathing in the Styrofoam. Often they had to be pried out & would wobble a little when first put on the ground. In the beginning the children tried to play with them, but the sharp hooves nicked their fingers & the ponies refused to jump over pencil hurdles. The children stopped feeding them sugarwater & the ponies were left to break their legs on the gardens' gravel paths or drown in the gutters. On the first day of the month, rats gathered on doorsteps & spat out only the bitter manes. Many a pony's last sight was a bounding squirrel with its tail hovering over its head like a halo. Behind the movie theatre the hardier ponies gathered in packs amongst the cigarette butts, getting their hooves stuck in wads of gum. They lined the hills at funerals, huddled under folding chairs at weddings. It became a matter of pride if one of your ponies proved unusually sturdy. People would smile & say, \"This would have been an awful month for me,\" pointing to the glossy palomino trotting energetically around their ankles. Eventually, the ponies were no longer needed. People had learned to imagine their sadness trotting away. & when they wanted something more tangible, they could always go to the racetrack & study the larger horses' faces. Gloom, #341, with those big black eyes, was almost sure to win."

        "Houdini": "There is a river under this poem.\n It flows blue and icy\n And carries these lines down the page.\n Somewhere beneath its surface\n Lying chained to the silt\n Harry holds his breath\n And slowly files\n His fingernails into moons.\n He wonders who still waits at the dock\n If the breasts of those young girls\n Have developed since he sank.\n He thinks of his parents\n Of listening to the tumblers\n Of his mother's womb\n Of escaping upward out of puberty\n Out of the pupils in his father's eyes\n And those hot Wisconsin fields.\n He dreams of escaping\n From this poem\n Of cracking the combinations\n To his own body\n And those warm young safes\n Of every girl on the dock.\n Jiggling his chains\n Harry scares a carp that circles\n And nibbles at his feet.\n He feels the blue rush of the current\n Sweeping across his body\n Stripping his chains of their rust\n Until each link softens\n And glows like a tiny eel.\n And Harry decides to ascend.\n He slips with the water\n Through his chains\n And climbing over and over\n His own air bubbles\n He waves to the fish\n To his chains glittering\n And squirming in the silt.\n He pauses to pick a bouquet\n Of seaweed for the young girls\n on the dock. Rising\n He bursts the surface of this poem.\n He listens for shouts.\n He hears only the night\n And a buoy sloshing in the blue.",
        "My Mother's Hats": "She kept them high on the top shelf,\n In boxes big as drums--\n\n Bright, crescent-shaped boats\n With little fishnets dangling down--\n\n And wore them with her best dress\n To teas, coffee parties, department stores.\n\n What a lovely catch, my father used to say,\n Watching her sail off into the afternoon waters.",
        "Raising the Titanic": "I spent the winter my father died down in the basement,\n under the calm surface of the floorboards, hundreds\n\n of little plastic parts spread out like debris\n on the table. And for months while the snow fell\n\n and my father sat in the big chair by the Philco, dying,\n I worked my way up deck by deck, story by story,\n\n from steerage to first class, until at last it was done,\n stacks, deck chairs, all the delicate rigging.\n\n And there it loomed, a blazing city of the dead.\n Then painted the gaping hole at the waterline\n\n and placed my father at the railings, my mother\n in a lifeboat pulling away from the wreckage.",
        "This Morning I Could Do/A Thousand Things": "I could fix the leaky pipe\n Under the sink, or wander over\nAnd bother Jerry who's lost\nIn the bog of his crankcase.\n I could drive the half-mile down\n To the local mall and browse\n Through the bright stables\n Of mowers, or maybe catch\n The power-walkers puffing away\n On their last laps. I could clean\n The garage, weed the garden,\n Or get out the shears and\n Prune the rose bushes back.\n Yes, a thousand things\n This beautiful April morning. \nBut I've decided to just lie\nHere in this old hammock,\n Rocking like a lazy metronome,\n And wait for the day lilies\n To open. The sun is barely\n Over the trees, and already\n The sprinklers are out,\n Raining their immaculate\n Bands of light over the lawns.",
        "The Old Liberators": "Of all the people in the mornings at the mall,   \n it's the old liberators I like best,   \n those veterans of the Bulge, Anzio, or Monte Cassino   \n I see lost in Automotive or back in Home Repair,   \n bored among the paints and power tools.   \n Or the really old ones, the ones who are going fast,   \n who keep dozing off in the little orchards   \n of shade under the distant skylights.   \n All around, from one bright rack to another,   \n their wives stride big as generals,   \n their handbags bulging like ripe fruit.   \n They are almost all gone now,   \n and with them they are taking the flak   \n and fire storms, the names of the old bombing runs.   \n Each day a little more of their memory goes out,   \n darkens the way a house darkens,   \n its rooms quietly filling with evening,   \n until nothing but the wind lifts the lace curtains,   \n the wind bearing through the empty rooms   \n the rich far off scent of gardens   \n where just now, this morning,   \n light is falling on the wild philodendrons."

I'm thinking,\n  \n it wasn't so long ago I carried my tiny son\n piggyback through the woods to a waterfall;\n wasn't long ago I kissed Laura for the first time;\n wasn't long ago I lived in the house with my dog\n and sat with my notebook at the kitchen table\n on Sunday morning after working all night-\n sipping burnt coffee and scratching out lines,\n lighting my hundredth cigarette, starting over\n again, determined to write a love poem."

To be honest\n  \n my lover doesn't really like poetry,\n which I guess is why I plan to write\n such a bad one, so he can feel right\n  \n and strong and good in his beliefs.\n Tonight when I go see my lover\n he'll hold me as I've never been held\n  \n except by him and then I'll have to give him\n back. When you get new things\n you treat them like glass for a while\n  \n and then get used to them\n and manhandle them\n like everything else.\n  \n I don't want to give him back\n but partly it's not up to me and\n partly I don't want to be his\n  \n old sofa. I want to radiate and gleam\n arrestingly until the certain, premature\n end. You can compose a whole life\n  \n out of these rollercoasters.\n You can be everywhere\n and nowhere, over and over\n\n life slapping you in the face\n  till you're newly burnished\n flat-out gasping and awake."

I imagined--I guess -- all this would last forever, if I imagined it at all. Now I'm in my seventies and all I can think about is the time when my life will be here no more.\n         For example, I love being in the woods felling and bucking hardwood trees, stacking and covering the blocks, then a year or two later, hauling them to the woodshed where I stack them again, and split them all winter long into the right size for the weather--then bring them into the house.\n         Now this chore I love so much is seriously painful, and I can see, now, an end to it."

        "Study in Orange and White": "I knew that James Whistler was part of the Paris scene,\n but I was still surprised when I found the painting\n of his mother at the Musee d'Orsay\n among all the colored dots and mobile brushstrokes\n of the French Impressionists.\n\n And I was surprised to notice\n after a few minutes of benign staring,\n how that woman, stark in profile\n and fixed forever in her chair,\n began to resemble my own ancient mother\n who was now fixed forever in the stars, the air, the earth.\n\n You can understand why he titled the painting\n \"Arrangement in Gray and Black\"\n instead of what everyone naturally calls it,\n but afterward, as I walked along the river bank,\n I imagined how it might have broken\n the woman's heart to be demoted from mother\n to a mere composition, a study in colorlessness.\n\n As the summer couples leaned into each other\n along the quay and the wide, low-slung boats\n full of spectators slid up and down the Seine\n between the carved stone bridges\n and their watery reflections,\n I thought: how ridiculous, how off-base.\n\n It would be like Botticelli calling \"The Birth of Venus\"\n \"Composition in Blue, Ochre, Green, and Pink,\"\n or the other way around\n like Rothko titling one of his sandwiches of color\n \"Fishing Boats Leaving Falmouth Harbor at Dawn.\"\n\n Or, as I scanned the menu at the cafe\n where I now had come to rest,\n it would be like painting something laughable,\n like a chef turning on a spit\n over a blazing fire in front of an audience of ducks\n and calling it \"Study in Orange and White.\"\n\n But by that time, a waiter had appeared\n with my glass of Pernod and a clear pitcher of water,\n and I sat there thinking of nothing\n but the women and men passing by--\n mothers and sons walking their small fragile dogs--\n and about myself,\n a kind of composition in blue and khaki,\n and, now that I had poured\n some water into the glass, milky-green.",
        "Irish Poetry": "That morning under a pale hood of sky   I heard the unambiguous scrape of spackling   against the side of our wickered, penitential house.    The day mirled and clabbered   in the thick, stony light,   and the rooks' feathered narling   astounded the salt waves, the plush coast.    I lugged a bucket past the forked   coercion of a tree, up toward   the pious and nictitating preeminence of a school,   hunkered there in its gully of learning.    Only later, by the galvanized washstand,   while gaunt, phosphorescent heifers   swam beyond the windows,   did the whorled and sparky gib of the indefinite   wobble me into knowledge.    Then, I heard the ghost-clink of milk bottle   on the rough threshold   and understood the meadow-bells   that trembled over a nimbus of ragwort--   the whole afternoon lambent, corrugated, puddle-mad.",
        "The Breather": "Just as in the horror movies when someone discovers that the phone calls are coming from inside the house  so too, I realized  that our tender overlapping has been taking place only inside me.  All that sweetness, the love and desire-- it's just been me dialing myself then following the ringing to another room  to find no one on the line, well, sometimes a little breathing but more often than not, nothing.  To think that all this time-- which would include the boat rides, the airport embraces, and all the drinks--  it's been only me and the two telephones, the one on the wall in the kitchen and the extension in the darkened guest room upstairs.",
        "The Chairs That No One Sits In": "You see them on porches and on lawns down by the lakeside, usually arranged in pairs implying a couple  who might sit there and look out at the water or the big shade trees. The trouble is you never see anyone  sitting in these forlorn chairs though at one time it must have seemed   a good place to stop and do nothing for a while.  Sometimes there is a little table between the chairs where no one   is resting a glass or placing a book facedown.  It might be none of my business, but it might be a good idea one day for everyone who placed those vacant chairs  on a veranda or a dock to sit down in them for the sake of remembering whatever it was they thought deserved  to be viewed from two chairs   side by side with a table in between. The clouds are high and massive that day.  The woman looks up from her book. The man takes a sip of his drink. Then there is nothing but the sound of their looking,  the lapping of lake water, and a call of one bird then another, cries of joy or warning-- it passes the time to wonder which.",
        "Memorizing \"The Sun Rising\" by John Donne": "Every reader loves the way he tells off the sun, shouting busy old fool into the English skies even though they were likely cloudy on that seventeenth-century morning.And it's a pleasure to spend this sunny daypacing the carpet and repeating the words, feeling the syllables lock into rowsuntil I can stand and declare, the book held closed by my side,that hours, days, and months are but the rags of time.But after a few steps into stanza number two,wherein the sun is blinded by his mistress's eyes, I can feel the first one begin to fade like sky-written letters on a windy day.And by the time I have taken in the third, the second is likewise gone, a blown-out candle now,a wavering line of acrid smoke.So it's not until I leave the houseand walk three times around this hidden lakethat the poem begins to showany interest in walking by my side.Then, after my circling,better than the courteous dominion of her being all states and him all princes, better than love's power to shrinkthe wide world to the size of a bedchamber, and better even than the compressionof all that into the rooms of these three stanzasis how, after hours stepping up and down the poem,testing the plank of every line,it goes with me now, contracted into a little spot within.",
        "Questions About Angels": "Of all the questions you might want to ask\n about angels, the only one you ever hear\n is how many can dance on the head of a pin.\n\n No curiosity about how they pass the eternal time\n besides circling the Throne chanting in Latin\n or delivering a crust of bread to a hermit on earth\n or guiding a boy and girl across a rickety wooden bridge.\n\n Do they fly through God's body and come out singing?\n Do they swing like children from the hinges\n of the spirit world saying their names backwards and forwards?\n Do they sit alone in little gardens changing colors?\n\n What about their sleeping habits, the fabric of their robes,\n their diet of unfiltered divine light?\n What goes on inside their luminous heads? Is there a wall\n these tall presences can look over and see hell?\n\n If an angel fell off a cloud, would he leave a hole\n in a river and would the hole float along endlessly\n filled with the silent letters of every angelic word?\n\n If an angel delivered the mail, would he arrive\n in a blinding rush of wings or would he just assume\n the appearance of the regular mailman and\n whistle up the driveway reading the postcards?\n\n No, the medieval theologians control the court.\n The only question you ever hear is about\n the little dance floor on the head of a pin\n where halos are meant to converge and drift invisibly.\n\n It is designed to make us think in millions,\n billions, to make us run out of numbers and collapse\n into infinity, but perhaps the answer is simply one:\n one female angel dancing alone in her stocking feet,\n a small jazz combo working in the background.\n\n She sways like a branch in the wind, her beautiful\n eyes closed, and the tall thin bassist leans over\n to glance at his watch because she has been dancing\n forever, and now it is very late, even for musicians.",
        "The Wires of the Night": "I thought about his death for so many hours,\n tangled there in the wires of the night,\n that it came to have a body and dimensions,\n more than a voice shaking over the telephone\n or the black obituary boldface of name and dates.\n\n His death now had an entrance and an exit,\n doors and stairs,\n windows and shutters which are the motionless wings\n of windows. His death had a head and clothes,\n the white shirt and baggy trousers of death.\n\n His death had pages, a dark leather cover, an index,\n and the print was too minuscule for anyone to read.\n His death had hinges and bolts that were oiled\n and locked,\n had a loud motor, four tires, an antenna that listened\n to the wind, and a mirror in which you could see the past.\n\n His death had sockets and keys, it had walls and beams.\n It had a handle which you could not hold and a floor\n you could not lie down on in the middle of the night.\n\n In the freakish pink and gray of dawn I took\n his death to bed with me and his death was my bed\n and in every corner of the room it hid from the light,\n\n and then it was the light of day and the next day\n and all the days to follow, and it moved into the future\n like the sharp tip of a pen moving across an empty page.",
        "Nostalgia": "Remember the 1340s? We were doing a dance called the Catapult.\n You always wore brown, the color craze of the decade,\n and I was draped in one of those capes that were popular,\n the ones with unicorns and pomegranates in needlework.\n Everyone would pause for beer and onions in the afternoon,\n and at night we would play a game called \"Find the Cow.\"\n Everything was hand-lettered then, not like today.\n\n Where has the summer of 1572 gone? Brocade and sonnet\n marathons were the rage. We used to dress up in the flags\n of rival baronies and conquer one another in cold rooms of stone.\n Out on the dance floor we were all doing the Struggle\n while your sister practiced the Daphne all alone in her room.\n We borrowed the jargon of farriers for our slang.\n These days language seems transparent, a badly broken code.\n\n The 1790s will never come again. Childhood was big.\n People would take walks to the very tops of hills\n and write down what they saw in their journals without speaking.\n Our collars were high and our hats were extremely soft.\n We would surprise each other with alphabets made of twigs.\n It was a wonderful time to be alive, or even dead.\n\n I am very fond of the period between 1815 and 1821.\n Europe trembled while we sat still for our portraits.\n And I would love to return to 1901 if only for a moment,\n time enough to wind up a music box and do a few dance steps,\n or shoot me back to 1922 or 1941, or at least let me\n recapture the serenity of last month when we picked\n berries and glided through afternoons in a canoe.\n\n Even this morning would be an improvement over the present.\n I was in the garden then, surrounded by the hum of bees\n and the Latin names of flowers, watching the early light\n flash off the slanted windows of the greenhouse\n and silver the limbs on the rows of dark hemlocks.\n\n As usual, I was thinking about the moments of the past,\n letting my memory rush over them like water\n rushing over the stones on the bottom of a stream.\n I was even thinking a little about the future, that place\n where people are doing a dance we cannot imagine,\n a dance whose name we can only guess.",
        "Workshop": "I might as well begin by saying how much I like the title.\n It gets me right away because I'm in a workshop now\n so immediately the poem has my attention,\n like the Ancient Mariner grabbing me by the sleeve.\n\n And I like the first couple of stanzas,\n the way they establish this mode of self-pointing\n that runs through the whole poem\n and tells us that words are food thrown down\n on the ground for other words to eat.\n I can almost taste the tail of the snake\n in its own mouth,\n if you know what I mean.\n\n But what I'm not sure about is the voice,\n which sounds in places very casual, very blue jeans,\n but other times seems standoffish,\n professorial in the worst sense of the word\n like the poem is blowing pipe smoke in my face.\n But maybe that's just what it wants to do.\n\n What I did find engaging were the middle stanzas,\n especially the fourth one.\n I like the image of clouds flying like lozenges\n which gives me a very clear picture.\n And I really like how this drawbridge operator\n just appears out of the blue\n with his feet up on the iron railing\n and his fishing pole jigging--I like jigging--\n a hook in the slow industrial canal below.\n I love slow industrial canal below. All those l's.\n\n Maybe it's just me,\n but the next stanza is where I start to have a problem.\n I mean how can the evening bump into the stars?\n And what's an obbligato of snow?\n Also, I roam the decaffeinated streets.\n At that point I'm lost. I need help.\n\n The other thing that throws me off,\n and maybe this is just me,\n is the way the scene keeps shifting around.\n First, we're in this big aerodrome\n and the speaker is inspecting a row of dirigibles,\n which makes me think this could be a dream.\n Then he takes us into his garden,\n the part with the dahlias and the coiling hose,\n though that's nice, the coiling hose,\n but then I'm not sure where we're supposed to be.\n The rain and the mint green light,\n that makes it feel outdoors, but what about this wallpaper?\n Or is it a kind of indoor cemetery?\n There's something about death going on here.\n\n In fact, I start to wonder if what we have here\n is really two poems, or three, or four,\n or possibly none.\n\n But then there's that last stanza, my favorite.\n This is where the poem wins me back,\n especially the lines spoken in the voice of the mouse.\n I mean we've all seen these images in cartoons before,\n but I still love the details he uses\n when he's describing where he lives.\n The perfect little arch of an entrance in the baseboard,\n the bed made out of a curled-back sardine can,\n the spool of thread for a table.\n I start thinking about how hard the mouse had to work\n night after night collecting all these things\n while the people in the house were fast asleep,\n and that gives me a very strong feeling,\n a very powerful sense of something.\n But I don't know if anyone else was feeling that.\n Maybe that was just me.\n Maybe that's just the way I read it.",
        "Print": "In the dining room there is a brown fish\n hanging on the wall who swims along\n in his frame while we are eating dinner.\n\n He swims in candlelight for all to see,\n as if he has been swimming forever, even\n in the darkness of the ink before someone thought\n\n to draw him and the thin reeds waving in his stream\n and the clear pebbles strewn upon the sand.\n No wonder he continues his swimming\n\n deep into the night, long after we have\n blown out the candles and gone upstairs to bed.\n No wonder I find him in the pale morning\n\n light, still swimming, still looking out at me\n with his one, small, spellbound eye.",
        "Man in Space": "All you have to do is listen to the way a man\n sometimes talks to his wife at a table of people\n and notice how intent he is on making his point\n even though her lower lip is beginning to quiver,\n\n and you will know why the women in science\n fiction movies who inhabit a planet of their own\n are not pictured making a salad or reading a magazine\n when the men from earth arrive in their rocket,\n\n why they are always standing in a semicircle\n with their arms folded, their bare legs set apart,\n their breasts protected by hard metal disks.",
        "Introduction to Poetry": "I ask them to take a poem\n and hold it up to the light\n like a color slide\n\n or press an ear against its hive.\n\n I say drop a mouse into a poem\n and watch him probe his way out,\n\n or walk inside the poem's room\n and feel the walls for a light switch.\n\n I want them to waterski\n across the surface of a poem\n waving at the author's name on the shore.\n\n But all they want to do\n is tie the poem to a chair with rope\n and torture a confession out of it.\n\n They begin beating it with a hose\n to find out what it really means.",
        "Morning": "Why do we bother with the rest of the day,\n the swale of the afternoon,\n the sudden dip into evening,\n\n then night with his notorious perfumes,\n his many-pointed stars?\n\n This is the best--\n throwing off the light covers,\n feet on the cold floor,\n and buzzing around the house on espresso--\n\n maybe a splash of water on the face,\n a palmful of vitamins--\n but mostly buzzing around the house on espresso,\n\n dictionary and atlas open on the rug,\n the typewriter waiting for the key of the head,\n a cello on the radio,\n\n and, if necessary, the windows--\n trees fifty, a hundred years old\n out there,\n heavy clouds on the way\n and the lawn steaming like a horse\n in the early morning.",
        "Today": "If ever there were a spring day so perfect,\n so uplifted by a warm intermittent breeze\n\n that it made you want to throw\n open all the windows in the house\n\n and unlatch the door to the canary's cage,\n indeed, rip the little door from its jamb,\n\n a day when the cool brick paths\n and the garden bursting with peonies\n\n seemed so etched in sunlight\n that you felt like taking\n\n a hammer to the glass paperweight\n on the living room end table,\n\n releasing the inhabitants\n from their snow-covered cottage\n\n so they could walk out,\n holding hands and squinting\n\n into this larger dome of blue and white,\n well, today is just that kind of day.",
        "No Time": "In a rush this weekday morning,\nI tap the horn as I speed past the cemetery \nwhere my parents are buried\nside by side beneath a slab of smooth  granite. \n\nThen, all day, I think of him rising up \nto give me that look \nof knowing disapproval \nwhile my mother calmly tells him to lie back down.",
        "The Parade": "How exhilarating it was to march \nalong the great boulevards \nin the sunflash of trumpets \nand under all the waving flags--\nthe flag of ambition, the flag of love. \n\nSo many of us streaming along--\nall of humanity, really--\nmoving in perfect step, \nyet each lost in the room of a private dream. \n\nHow stimulating the scenery of the world, \nthe rows of roadside trees, \nthe huge curtain of the sky. \n\nHow endless it seemed until we veered \noff the broad turnpike \ninto a pasture of high grass, \nheaded toward the dizzying cliffs of mortality. \n\nGeneration after generation, \nwe keep shouldering forward \nuntil we step off the lip into space. \n\nAnd I should not have to remind you \nthat little time is given here \nto rest on a wayside bench, \nto stop and bend to the wildflowers, \nor to study a bird on a branch--\n\nnot when the young \nare always shoving from behind, \nnot when the old keep tugging us forward, \npulling on our arms with all their feeble strength.",
        "Writing in the Afterlife": "I imagined the atmosphere would be clear, \nshot with pristine light, \nnot this sulphurous haze, \nthe air ionized as before a thunderstorm. \n\nMany have pictured a river here, \nbut no one mentioned all the boats, \ntheir benches crowded with naked passengers, \neach bent over a writing tablet. \n\nI knew I would not always be a child \nwith a model train and a model tunnel, \nand I knew I would not live forever, \njumping all day through the hoop of myself. \n\nI had heard about the journey to the other side \nand the clink of the final coin \nin the leather purse of the man holding the oar, \nbut how could anyone have guessed \n\nthat as soon as we arrived \nwe would be asked to describe this place \nand to include as much detail as possible-- \nnot just the water, he insists, \n\nrather the oily, fathomless, rat-happy water, \nnot simply the shackles, but the rusty, \niron, ankle-shredding shackles-- \nand that our next assignment would be \n\nto jot down, off the tops of our heads, \nour thoughts and feelings about being dead, \nnot really an assignment, \nthe man rotating the oar keeps telling us-- \n\nthink of it more as an exercise, he groans, \nthink of writing as a process, \na never-ending, infernal process, \nand now the boats have become jammed together, \n\nbow against stern, stern locked to bow, \nand not a thing is moving, only our diligent pens."

The disposability of Black girls who are prone to disappearance. A body bag somewhere waits with little hoopla about its lot. Absence becomes the lot of Black girls.\n \n_________ will eventually accept as fact that absence becomes a lot of Black girls. In what becomes the normal day-to-day, Black girls are harder to find, _________ would think first, not that there are few attempts to find them. The question isn't whether Black girls often go missing. If no one else, Black girls miss each other.\n \n_________  would be remiss to not recognize how everything is made less in the absence of Black girls, if _________ could miss what _________ have never been required to recognize, such as:\n \nUnlike missing Black girls, taking Black girls is a Western custom. It seems likely that such a statement will soon appear inaccurate: the white space in new textbook editions will have nothing to say about it, if the white spaces behind those textbooks have anything to say about it. That Black girls are quintessential American palimpsests is not a question but an anxiety. _________ would rather forget that Black girls were made receptacles for what the authors of Liberty and Independence would not speak. That Liberty and Independence were imaginable only in the absent-presence of taken Black girls, enslaved Black girls, Black girls on whom a foundational economic system so depended that white men would kill each other and take taken Black girls.\n \nThe constancy of Black girls is someone's anxiety. The soil is thick with hidden Black girls, the myth that only quiet Black girls are worthwhile Black girls. The soil turns as _________  turn away from loud Black girls and their cacophonic insistence on Black girls.\n \n_________ have not insisted enough upon the fact of Black girls, are often loudly shocked to find Black girls disappeared. Loud, unsustainable shock has a way of disappearing Black girls. Outrage, too, has a way of being disappeared.",

You too\n  \n once knew what it was to feel impressive. As the bed dissolves\n into the walls, the walls disrobe themselves of their edges\n and your resolve is now acute in the locking jaw of darkness.\n Beg to be let. You, like bravery, leave behind the breath-inflated\n  \n lump, its depths, and its refusal to lace the cells of scars over even\n the metaphorical guttings. To manage the act exceeds the box-\n and-whisker of lately's along-going. You've grown so accustomed\n to mereness that what you call a life no longer houses the sublime.\n  \n It seems easy to leave. It seems this easy to leave. After\n a second you'll want to consider the centimeters of resistance\n stitching air between here and all of elsewhere. But, still,\n inhabit the bodiless second. To possess it is a bearable joy.",

Let me leave\n and come back when my chest opens for you wider\n than your ditches did to engorge my placeless body.\n  \n The mosquito-thick breath in your throat coats my skin\n and it almost feels as if you love me.

Let the cop car\n swerve its nose into night and not see none of them.\n Let us smell rain. Let the breeze through an oak hymn\n the promise that keeps us waking.

There was salt in his seams\n and the slip between my knees slumped with heat\n\n and sheets jedidiah-teething the clothesline already.\n Followed hours full of our trying to be full of each other\n\n and sunlight yearning like egg white through\n the cracked curtains\n\n and the usual evidence of bluegrass his shoulders shed\n beneath my nails, the rooms in me he could not enter\n\n branching annexes: my elderberry privacies.\n Out of the yard's farthest hem, darkness\n\n from the world's first days braided into the tobacco\n\n and I could only imagine tomorrow\n if I expected to be slaughtered in my sleep."

Thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise     Twenty times better; but once, in special, In thin array, after a pleasant guise,     When her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,     And she me caught in her arms long and small;          Therewith all sweetly did me kiss,          And softly said, 'Dear heart, how like you this?'  It was no dream: I lay broad waking:     But all is turned, thorough my gentleness, Into a strange fashion of forsaking;     And I have leave to go of her goodness,     And she also to use newfangleness.

As to be heard where ear is none, As lead to grave in marble stone, My song may pierce her heart as soon; Should we then sigh or sing or moan? No, no, my lute, for I have done.  The rocks do not so cruelly Repulse the waves continually, As she my suit and affection; So that I am past remedy, Whereby my lute and I have done.  Proud of the spoil that thou hast got Of simple hearts thorough Love's shot, By whom, unkind, thou hast them won, Think not he hath his bow forgot, Although my lute and I have done.  Vengeance shall fall on thy disdain That makest but game on earnest pain. Think not alone under the sun Unquit to cause thy lovers plain, Although my lute and I have done.  Perchance thee lie wethered and old The winter nights that are so cold, Plaining in vain unto the moon; Thy wishes then dare not be told; Care then who list, for I have done.  And then may chance thee to repent The time that thou hast lost and spent To cause thy lovers sigh and swoon; Then shalt thou know beauty but lent, And wish and want as I have done.  Now cease, my lute; this is the last Labour that thou and I shall waste, And ended is that we begun. Now is this song both sung and past: My lute be still, for I have done.",
        "Mine own John Poynz": "Mine own John Poynz, since ye delight to knowThe cause why that homeward I me draw,And flee the press of courts, whereso they go,Rather than to live thrall under the aweOf lordly looks, wrapped within my cloak,To will and lust learning to set a law:It is not for because I scorn or mockThe power of them, to whom fortune hath lentCharge over us, of right, to strike the stroke.But true it is that I have always meantLess to esteem them than the common sort,Of outward things that judge in their intentWithout regard what doth inward resort.I grant sometime that of glory the fireDoth twyche my heart. Me list not to reportBlame by honour, and honour to desire.But how may I this honour now attain,That cannot dye the colour black a liar?My Poynz, I cannot from me tune to feign,To cloak the truth for praise without desertOf them that list all vice for to retain.I cannot honour them that sets their partWith Venus and Bacchus all their life long;Nor hold my peace of them although I smart.I cannot crouch nor kneel to do so great a wrong,To worship them, like God on earth alone,That are as wolves these sely lambs among.I cannot with my word complain and moan,And suffer nought, nor smart without complaint,Nor turn the word that from my mouth is gone.I cannot speak and look like a saint,Use willes for wit, and make deceit a pleasure,And call craft counsel, for profit still to paint.I cannot wrest the law to fill the cofferWith innocent blood to feed myself fat,And do most hurt where most help I offer.I am not he that can allow the stateOf him Caesar, and damn Cato to die,That with his death did scape out of the gateFrom Caesar's hands (if Livy do not lie)And would not live where liberty was lost;So did his heart the common weal apply.I am not he such eloquence to boastTo make the crow singing as the swan;Nor call the liond of cowardes beasts the mostThat cannot take a mouse as the cat can;And he that dieth for hunger of the goldCall him Alexander; and say that PanPasseth Apollo in music many fold;Praise Sir Thopias for a noble tale,And scorn the story that the Knight told;Praise him for counsel that is drunk of ale;Grin when he laugheth that beareth all the sway,Frown when he frowneth and groan when is pale;On others' lust to hang both night and day:None of these points would ever frame in me.My wit is nought--I cannot learn the way.And much the less of things that greater be,That asken help of colours of deviceTo join the mean with each extremity,With the nearest virtue to cloak alway the vice;And as to purpose, likewise it shall fallTo press the virtue that it may not rise;As drunkenness good fellowship to call;The friendly foe with his double faceSay he is gentle and courteous therewithal;And say that favel hath a goodly graceIn eloquence; and cruelty to nameZeal of justice and change in time and place;And he that suffer'th offence without blameCall him pitiful; and him true and plainThat raileth reckless to every man's shame.Say he is rude that cannot lie and feign;The lecher a lover; and tyrannyTo be the right of a prince's reign.I cannot, I; no, no, it will not be!This is the cause that I could never yetHang on their sleeves that way, as thou mayst see,A chip of chance more than a pound of wit.This maketh me at home to hunt and to hawk,And in foul weather at my book to sit;In frost and snow then with my bow to stalk;No man doth mark whereso I ride or go:In lusty leas at liberty I walk.And of these news I feel nor weal nor woe,Save that a clog doth hang yet at my heel.No force for that, for it is ordered so,That I may leap both hedge and dyke full well.I am not now in France to judge the wine,With saffry sauce the delicates to feel;Nor yet in Spain, where one must him inclineRather than to be, outwardly to seem:I meddle not with wits that be so fine.Nor Flanders' cheer letteth not my sight to deemOf black and white; nor taketh my wit awayWith beastliness; they beasts do so esteem.Nor I am not where Christ is given in preyFor money, poison, and treason at Rome--A common practice used night and day:But here I am in Kent and ChristendomAmong the Muses where I read and rhyme;Where if thou list, my Poinz, for to come,Thou shalt be judge how I do spend my time.",

        "Unstable Dream": "Unstable dream, according to the place,Be steadfast once, or else at least be true.By tasted sweetness make me not to rueThe sudden loss of thy false feigned grace.By good respect in such a dangerous caseThou broughtest not her into this tossing mewBut madest my sprite live, my care to renew,My body in tempest her succour to embrace.The body dead, the sprite had his desire,Painless was th'one, th'other in delight.Why then, alas, did it not keep it right,Returning, to leap into the fire?     And where it was at wish, it could not remain,     Such mocks of dreams they turn to deadly pain.",
        "What Needeth these Threat'ning Words": "What needeth these threnning words and wasted wind?All this cannot make me restore my prey.To rob your good, iwis, is not my mind,Nor causeless your fair hand did I display.Let love be judge or else whom next we meetThat may both hear what you and I can say:She took from me an heart, and I a glove from her.Let us see now if th'one be worth th'other.",

Familiarity breeds                   content.

Poetry should not be in the service of art any more than religion, ideology,                        or morality. Poetry should be in the service of nothing -- and not even                        that.                        If  you can identify someone as gnostic they are probably                     notgnostic enough,                                                      for my money.            I believe in my disbelief, have faith in my reason.                       The sacred in a poem is nowhere seen and everywhere                       felt. There's                more to transgression than                                                                           ritual, but not enoughmore.

You're not the only paddle in the ocean, shadow in the dark, line in        the poem, lobster in the trap, pot on the stove, wheel on the truck,        letter on the keypad, scythe in the field, lever on the controls, cloud        in the sky, fruit in the tree, rat in the lab.                 Reality is usually a poor copy of the imitation. The original            is an echo of what is yet to be.                                  Time is neither linear nor circular; it is excremental.       Beauty is the memory of the loss of time.                                    Memory                                     is                                     the                                     reflection                                     of                                     the                                     loss                                     of                                     beauty.               American poetry suffers from its lack of     uncreativity. I have no faith in faith, or hope                                  for hope, no belief  in belief, no doubt of doubt.                                                         They say God is in the details. That's                                                   because the Devil has the rest                                   covered.God is weak and imaginary -- a flickering possibility. The dogma of an omniscient and omnipotent God maligns hope and denies the sacred, as it turns its back on the world.        God has no doctrine, no morality, no responsibility. To sin against    God is to use that name to justify any action or prohibition, whether    murder or martyrdom.I've got authenticity, you've got dogma  ...    proclaimeth the Lord.

        "Dear Mr. Fanelli,": "I saw your picture\n in the 79th street\n station. You said\n you'd be interested\n in any comments I\n might have on the\n condition of the\n station Mr. Fanelli,\n there is a lot of\n debris in the 79th street\n station that makes it\n unpleasant to wait in\n for more than a few\n minutes. The station\n could use a paint\n job and maybe\n new speakers so you\n could understand\n the delay announcements\n that are always being\n broadcast. Mr.\n Fanelli--there are\n a lot of people sleeping\n in the 79th street station\n & it makes me sad\n to think they have no\n home to go to. Mr.\n Fanelli, do you think\n you could find a more\n comfortable place for them\n to rest? It's pretty noisy\n in the subway, especially\n all those express trains\n hurtling through every\n few minutes, anyway when the\n trains are in service.\n I have to admit, Mr. Fanelli, I\n think the 79th street station's\n in pretty bad shape\n & sometimes at night\n as I toss in my bed\n I think the world's\n not doing too good\n either, & I\n wonder what's going\n to happen, where we're\n headed, if we're\n headed anywhere, if\n we even have heads. Mr.\n Fanelli, do you think if\n we could just start\n with the 79th street\n station & do what\n we could with that\n then maybe we could,\n you know, I guess, move\n on from there? Mr.\n Fanelli, when I saw your\n picture & the sign\n asking for suggestions\n I thought, if\n you really wanted to\n get to the bottom\n of what's wrong then\n maybe it was my job\n to write to you: Maybe\n you've never been inside\n the 79th street station\n because you're so busy\n managing the 72nd street\n & 66th street stations,\n maybe you don't know\n the problems we have\n at 79th--I mean the\n dirt & frequent\n delays & the feeling of\n total misery that\n pervades the place. Mr.\n Fanelli, are you reading\n this far in the letter\n or do you get so\n many letters every day\n that you don't have\n time to give each\n one the close attention\n it desires? Or am I\n the only person who's\n taken up your invitation\n to get in touch &\n you just don't have enough\n experience to know how to\n respond? I'm sorry\n I can't get your attention\n Mr. Fanelli because I really\n believe if you ask\n for comments then you\n ought to be willing\n to act on them--even\n if ought is too\n big a word to throw\n around at this point.\n Mr. Fanelli\n I hope you won't\n think I'm rude\n if I ask you a\n personal question. Do\n you get out of the\n office much?\n Do you go to the movies\n or do you prefer\n sports--or maybe\n quiet evenings at a\n local restaurant? Do\n you read much, Mr. Fanelli?\n I don't mean just\n Gibbons and like\n that, but philosophy--\n have you read much\n Hanna Arendt or\n do you prefer\n a more ideological\n perspective?\n I think if I understood\n where you are coming from,\n Mr. Fanelli, I could\n write to you more cogently,\n more persuasively. Mr.\n Fanelli, do you get out\n of the city at all--I\n mean like up to Bear\n Mountain or out to\n Montauk? I mean do you\n notice how unpleasant\n the air is in the 79th\n street station--that we\n could use some cooling\n or air-filtering system\n down there? Mr.\n Fanelli, do you think\n it's possible we\n could get together\n and talk about\n these things in\n person? There are\n a few other points\n I'd like to go over\n with you if I could\n get the chance. Things\n I'd like to talk to\n you about but that\n I'd be reluctant to\n put down on paper.\n Mr. Fanelli, I haven't\n been feeling very good\n lately and I thought\n meeting with you face\n to face might change\n my mood, might put\n me into a new frame\n of mind. Maybe we\n could have lunch?\n Or maybe after work?\n Think about it, Mr.\n Fanelli.",

Instead of fire, water--drops\n knocking on doors, wetting windows\n into mirrors reflecting me in the oaks.\n The garden walls and stones swelling\n into ghostlier shades of themselves,\n the wind chimes giggling in the storm,\n a coffee cup left overflowing with rain.\n Instead of burning, my pages turned\n into water lilies floating over puddles,\n then tiny white cliffs as the sun set,\n finally drying all night under the moon\n into papier-mache souvenirs. Today\n the rain would not let their lives burn.",

        "Life Form": "Will haul this gelatinous body, will lash forward this non-form, will push this organism of gas through the gray regions.\n \nA sour wind tears through the thin white hair. A wind of vinegar and henbane tears in the rustling, discarded bird-shells that were abandoned empty and fragile when the throbbing bird-boils moved on toward so-called life. Now I see the cunning needle-trees sling these clumps of heavy pouch-flesh back and forth between them: small feather-birds \"fly\" above my heads.\n \nI haul myself, I haul myself, I haul my dragging structure along the river furrow's muddy, sloppily overlapping slopes. I am so bitter, so wet, so the mouth smears the inside with the sweetness of the chewed-up blood-chisel. Out of this blood I am going to suck my nourishment for some time.\n \nI haul, I urge my dissolved substance, slowly forward across the metal of calm stones, the hovering thread-glue's suction toward a point in the distant middle of the perspective. Where the river's banks will meet and like the thinnest needle of silver of liquid will drill its dark tunnel-water straight into the heart of the dying image, this moistly broken-up surface of paper to which we cling.\n \nI haul I haul I touch myself, touch the skin-rind with chafed-up viscous fingers. Little mermaid from ocean foam molded-I haul my long veils, layers of elastic cartilage, of slippery, shimmering membranes, chlorophyll. The gills shudder and glow deep down in this chasm of tissue-constantly rustling, squeaking, gasping for air. This whirling, howling, desperate lack of oxygen; the scream-if it had had enough oxygen to scream and a mouth with which to scream-the scream to swallow the entire lung full of clear wind.\n \nLizards play, glitter green, blue, and red between the skin membranes of the body dress. Where does this mass end? I search inward through strata to find the core of my plasma wet from juices, to find the core of body-flesh despite the outer, surrounding flesh, the naked body's stable surface, a kind of human here inside the bluing, plant-becoming. Something to hold on to behind the spread of the sickness of mud, fermentation. But there is nothing to grasp beneath this mantle of slippery webbed skin, burst through by a pounding net of veins.\n \nI now lick my tongue against the outer claws of the fingers to tear life into the ions, to make sores bitter in the tongue's blue ventricles. A kind of pain therefore radiates against the inner glands, a faint spasm of cheers before this, the nervous system's last chance to communicate with the dying I. The mists smart, shimmer, the lumps of blue cobalt from the mustard gas corrode through the otherwise red shroud-clouds that drag their bellies against the river's surface. In one of the skin-folds between the pockets of the genital dress, lizards gather in heaps of glimmering scales.\n \nBut time runs on time and starvation and the weakness carries me in across the gray regions. And the soul's dark night will slowly be lowered through me. That is why I now slowly fold myself like a muscle against the wet clay to press the flesh against the sleep-gland's mouths. I will sleep now in my bird body in the down, and a bitter star will radiate eternally above the glowing face's watercourse."

        "New Year's Eve 1989": "Up on the roof, waiting for the fireworks to begin\n in warm winter rain, a moment ago I stepped\n from the elevator into the black air\n of an almost New Year\n and need a minute to catch my breath\n at the spread of city open to my eye.\n I can't go to the edge; I never could.\n The old fear of height still troubles me,\n the sensation that nothing can be under me\n if I am surrounded by mist and rain\n and all of the dark night air we breathe.\n Even a glimpse at the treetops in the park,\n with its slick crisscrossing roads that plunge\n into the jumbled panorama of East Side Manhattan,\n hysterical tonight with its own incandescence,\n gives me the willies. I feel as if\n I were standing on the deck of a showboat of a cloud\n as it drifts down some dark river, waiting for it\n to bang into some other building's fifteenth floor.\n How can these old people hunch the railing,\n hoisting their plastic glasses of champagne\n from under dripping umbrellas, as if\n they drank the rain as they laugh\n their analyses of the weather?\n Maybe now, like me, they have nothing to lose.\n I moved in three weeks ago; this is my first trip\n to the roof. I don't want to die tonight,\n the first fatality of 1990! There's too much of me\n I left in pieces last year, oh, the whole last decade:\n But I'm up here to distract myself, temporarily,\n from what I don't want or can't have\n in the way of love. . . . That must be\n the Triborough Bridge, tied in its strings\n of blue lights, and I can see in Central Park\n the skating rink, like a scoured mirror below,\n where some madman waves a red lantern; he\n must be drunk. I have only sipped a speck of Drambuie,\n which I didn't carry in my Coca-Cola glass\n up to these festivities. This is the first New Year's\n I've spent alone in twenty, twenty-two years.\n I never could go to the edge; but I did.\n Out there in the dark: my marriage, the woman\n I loved badly, as she did me, or none too well;\n the places we lived; the apartment I once half-owned;\n the thousands of books I had to leave behind\n (though I am to be granted library privileges)\n and the black and white cat I really miss.\n My wife's with her friends tonight somewhere in Brooklyn;\n friends of mine out there, too, though I don't know\n where. It's just like me to move in the middle\n of a telephone company strike. Thus, no calls\n from anyone--and I don't even have\n a telephone yet, so who could call? Damp but trying\n to smile, I eye the revelers. Two young men\n and their enormous girlfriends have joined us,\n really large women who carry balloons, all ready\n to froth in merry champagne. We check\n our watches to the screams from swarms\n of apartment windows to the west\n as the sky lights up with the first furious\n bombardment of colored shells. I can see that\n red lantern swinging toward the rockets--aha!\n So it wasn't a drunk, but the fireworks engineer\n preparing to blow the year's last sky\n to smithereens for our delight!\n I like to follow the tiny spurts of flame\n from the launching pad in their heavenward trajectory\n as much as I like the rockets' red glare,\n the bombs bursting in air, which give proof\n to the night that I am still here, hands\n jammed in the pockets of my sodden raincoat,\n face dripping with rain, hat soaked, wondering\n if the skinny guy in the army jacket behind me\n (who looks just like I did in the sixties)\n is mumbling his way into a combat flashback\n and ready to hurl me over the edge of the roof\n and into kingdom come. I guess not yet. We've\n survived the first blasts of spinning green,\n corkscrews of spangled flame, buds of fireballs\n spewed in arching gold sprays, the whistling fire-fish\n that curl and howl as they flare, falling to ash.\n Screaming its head off, the New York New Year enters.\n I feel sad that beautiful things must die,\n even shadows made of smoke and flame,\n whatever I thought I had made out of my life--\n music, poems, books, kisses, a little useless fame.\n The army guy behind me grumbles at the haze\n of rocket smoke that coils around the trees,\n then tumbles up into the air toward Harlem.\n That bump and thud and bump sound everywhere,\n more clouds smacking each other head-on.\n The flashes of the explosions are close enough\n to touch if you wanted to burn your fingers\n on the sky, and the glare rocks our shadows back\n against the brick, as if chaos snapped\n our pictures in the dark. I smile for my portrait,\n curious at the New Year, smelling the acrid smoke\n of the one we've just destroyed. Then I squeeze into\n the tiny elevator car with the others, anonymous,\n reconciled to be so, back to my little apartment\n and the waiting glass of amber drink I'll raise,\n only half in jest, to my new life.",

She did say:\n \"It's all about Bill.\" She was right.\n And suddenly it frightens me, remembering\n how, at our wedding, our poet friends\n read poems of (mostly) utter depression\n to salute us. I wondered if their griefs in love\n had double-crossed our union, if strange\n snakes in the grass of our blissful Eden\n had hissed at us, and now I worry,\n on your wedding day, if I'm not\n doing the same damned thing . . . .\n\n I haven't come to spring up and put my curse\n on your bliss.

A little of that\n you unwittingly got today, when it rained\n and you couldn't be married outside under\n the beautiful tree in Nan and Alan's yard.\n But paradise doesn't have to be structured\n so that we can never reenter it. After\n you've kicked each other out of it\n once or twice (I'm speaking metaphorically,\n of course), teach yourself how to say\n a few kind words to each other.\n Don't stand there angry, stony.\n Each of you let the other know\n what you are feeling and thinking\n\n and then it may be possible\n to return to each other smiling,\n hand in hand. For arm in arm,\n you are your best Eden. Remember\n the advice the old poet sang to you\n on the afternoon of August 4, 2001,\n the day you got married.\n May you enjoy a good laugh\n thinking of him and his silver thumb\n now that you've turned the key\n into your new life in the beautiful\n Massachusetts rain and--hey, now--sun!",
        "Where X Marks the Spot": "Not long after you had told me, gently,\n that you still grieved for your last love,\n though that had ended almost a year before,\n and that you could have no intimate relationship\n with me, maybe not with anyone for a time,\n I stopped my fork in the air with whatever hung\n on the end of it that I was eating.\n My throat wouldn't swallow.\n I felt weak and sick, as if it were myself\n that I devoured, piece by piece, as you talked away\n the hopes that I had put in your lovely face.\n It was the old story coming true for me once more,\n though you were hardly mine. . . .\n When we finished I walked you back to your car;\n I don't remember having much to say.\n Why would I? Buildings drifted by,\n and cars, and faces. Then we arrived at the place\n where, afterwards, I would never see you again,\n at a parking lot near Times Square.\n There I marked the sidewalk with X's\n visible only to me: \"At this place\n I was lost again,\" they'd say to me\n when I walked there in the future.\n \"Dig here and find what's left of me,\n or what I left behind, where X marks the spot.\"\n I felt like the death's-head and crossed bones\n that surmount the treasure chest.\n I only felt a little like gold coins and jewels.\n I have signed the City with these sphinxes\n --in parks, in streets, in bedrooms,\n in my own apartments. And there we stood,\n you and I, hemmed in by the stitches of X's\n that could not hold you to me. But X's\n mean kisses, I realized, as well as\n what is lost: all the kisses I couldn't give you\n chalked like symbols on the sidewalk.\n After all, you yourself had been marked\n by loss, even in your laughter that afternoon\n at the show I had taken you to. Bright-eyed\n and smiling in the seat beside me, you\n stole my glances with your dark, dark eyes\n and your long hair. I thought that I had not been\n this happy in a long time with a woman\n and was ready to become even more happy,\n ready to do anything that you wanted\n in order to please you, to see that smile come up,\n not knowing what you were soon to say to me\n as we dined. And when you spoke,\n I felt life fall away from me. Again I felt\n that I would never be happy. I felt the words\n that I had wanted to say to you leaving me, rushing\n out of my chest like dead air, until I had no more words\n to say. I seemed to cut and swallow my food\n as if it were me myself that stuck in pieces\n on the end of the fork I had raised to my mouth.\n Had I been chewing on my own flesh?\n Self-Pity the Devourer took me by the hand\n that held the fork, and once again I feasted\n on all that was dark and hopeless in myself,\n in lieu of all that was beautiful, desirable,\n and unattainable in you. And then\n I stood beside you in the lot where you\n had parked your car, with the X's buzzing\n in the air, sticking themselves to you\n and me and the blacktop and the cars.\n When you reached out to embrace me, I\n moved to embrace you in return--and then came\n the part that I don't want to remember,\n the part I hate: I caught a glimpse of your\n face as we put our arms around each other,\n and your face said everything to me about\n how you had wasted the afternoon, how eager\n you were to speed away in your car, a mixture\n of disgust and relief that the thing would soon\n be over, that I would be crossed out forever\n from your life--and everything that I hated\n about myself, my stupid chin, my ugly nose,\n my hopeless balded head, my stuck-out ears,\n my wreck of a heart, crashed over me,\n spinning me into the vortex of a palpable self-hate\n that I have only ever let myself feel\n a little bit at a time, though it is always there"

The doctor, this morning, said\n that I was enlightened, but not\n  \n quite there--somehow--I can't remember\n how. I doubt he knows\n  \n what he means by \"enlightenment.\" I felt far away\n from my sister yesterday, when she called. Michael\n  \n talked to me of Christ's\n tenderness. I feel tender in this moment. Over\n  \n and over I feel that words\n do not represent me. I am not\n  \n sure what that implies of my intentions\n in using them. Yesterday, Brenda and I saw\n  \n the Warhol show of the last ten years\n of his life. There seemed to have been hope\n  \n to live meaningfully in capitalism then. ~~~~~~~ The waves\n of this beginning, the new life of my mind\n  \n is settling. It's been a while since I've written. I've decided\n to mark my continuing with the seven tildes above. And I added\n  \n a title tonight, Muerto Vecino, after Zizek's dubious interpretation\n of Kierkegaard's neighbor, and because of the funeral home\n  \n across the street. My thinking has changed, my being has changed,\n I am more alert and more engaged in thinking through the world.\n  \n And I am able to speak better. I don't know what this means\n about who I am. I try not to feel let down that for so much of my life\n  \n I've been restrained by psychotropic drugs. Before Zyprexa it was even\n worse, with up to 6 meds, as I've said over and over to friends. I feel\n  \n the need to make clear what my obstacles have been. Not for pity,\n a little for pride, but also for hope. If I can do that, then maybe I can help\n  \n someone not suffer so much, like Brenda. I replaced the kitchen faucet\n this past weekend. It makes me very happy that I was able to do it\n  \n successfully, without ever having been handy before in my life, and after\n spending most of my life disdainful of being practical in that way. What a joy\n  \n to make Brenda so happy. I don't know how much longer I will live,\n and have often thought, recently, that it would be tragic if I died anytime\n  \n soon, but that it's imperative that I accept death when it arrives, after\n affirming life as fully as I can. It's too easy, and stupid, to be simplistically\n  \n oppositional. And to not know that people can ruin anything, but\n that the substantial things have value of themselves, is foolish. I don't want to stop\n  \n at my own ignorance and lack of forbearance. I don't believe in the West\n on its own. As Michael says, the only thing that makes sense here\n  \n is love. I have everything I could possibly ever want or need for now. More books\n will come, more music too. And love is immeasurable\n  \n when it's real. I am so grateful to have more waking time\n on the weekends. I plan on making breakfast for Brenda\n  \n every Saturday and Sunday that I can\n from now on. Early. I see gardens in the future of our household.\n  \n And I wonder about a Great Spirit. What does the name matter? I see the stones that live\n without water. I see the smoke that cleanses my vision, and a network of consciousness,\n  \n with each node another, on and on that way to the depths. My thinking will never\n grasp it all\n  \n because of that recursively created network of interior life. My thinking stops\n then, barely able to contain the spherical and vast darkness\n  \n from which all light arises. That's why what I see is dark. It is brilliant\n in its darkness. Like onyx and flint. I can only talk around what I've seen\n  \n the past couple of weeks. It reframes, completely, the rest of my creative\n life and the rest of my days. All I aim to do now is to focus my attention,\n  \n so that I can see it all again in retrospect. So that I can read\n and gather more tools for understanding it. So that I understand myself,\n  \n and something of the world, and love, and so that I help others. Geodon\n will not erase it. I've seen it already, many times. It is my natural state.\n  \n I no longer see it as only hallucination. It is a way of being. A way that I can flesh\n out, here. Slowly. Carefully. And as I do, its destructive powers,\n  \n which are massive and righteous, will subside. As it will know that it is being\n given to the world. Because it belongs to all. And all will be there soon.\n  \n There are signs already. Because to see it is to break, unless one knows something\n of love. It makes LSD\n  \n small. It is God and the Universe as One.\n I am not the first to see it. But I am a person\n  \n given a chance\n to write it, letter by letter, slowly, in terms of the light of my ignorance\n  \n to see more fully\n what I do not know. I do not offer anything\n  \n but poems. But it breaks through\n my mouth to arrive at the hearts of the world, at the hearts of the horses\n  \n of the world, to allow us all to speak in silence. It is not God or the Universe.\n It is One as All in you. Because I cannot see through myself\n  \n without it. I see clearly\n that the sun will not arrive\n  \n in this new weather. But that the moon\n will take its place. I see clearly that the sun is there\n  \n to bring meaning to the sky, and that the earth is more full\n with the light of the world\n  \n extinguished for a brilliant view of wilderness. This is a view\n that extends through opposites\n  \n and arrives at a single body\n to witness this song. And this song is not the answer\n  \n that you believe in, because one day\n I will speak to you again\n  \n in the rain\n and show you\n  \n that I do not know. Because knowledge\n belongs to the earth. And the earth makes everything\n  \n I know. And now that there is less and less freedom\n from coercion in a moneyed world, and now that Claire,\n  \n a friend, is moving on to be Christ in her own way, now\n that Guenon continues to call me to understand\n  \n my ignorance, to depart again\n from the friends at Kuna Yala, where I helped with the water,\n  \n with Brenda watching over me\n from a hammock between palms, now that Panama\n  \n calls again to give me a union\n of the world, in more than two ways,\n  \n and to distinguish from the surface of these times, I\n receive\n  \n a call to awaken in the snow. I receive a call to acknowledge\n that Geodon has planted itself\n  \n with capital\n in my consciousness, but that the world\n  \n is stronger than to balance itself\n from the ozone and people alone. We are not erased, and we\n  \n do not control the earth. Geodon\n is an act of kindness, an agreement\n  \n to live this life\n in a way that arrives\n  \n with the weather. It may continue\n for the rest of my life, or it may not. I will not be afraid again\n  \n to see things as I do, and I will not\n seek out the truth, intentionally, without some kind of agreement\n  \n with this custom. Because that is a way, for now,\n that I speak. And it is useful, though better left\n  \n invisible. And the name, Geodon, brings trouble, I can see\n through it enough, with enough love in my life, to believe\n  \n in the end of the reign of the Anti-Christ (not Obama). I need to learn again\n to be and to write. But to deliver\n  \n what I saw\n I must return\n  \n to the explosion of my inner life. To start with, otherwise and generally, I see\n only outlines. Creation manifests\n  \n from every direction, in an infinity\n of dimensions. Most of us\n  \n spend most of our energy\n conscious of a very few of these dimensions. Imagine\n  \n more than the greatest works of art\n manifesting endlessly\n  \n from more directions than one can possibly count\n every micro second, timelessly. It's glorious.\n  \n And the only way to see it with any balance\n is impeccably, ethically, compassionately, and with at least an aim\n  \n toward the Divine. It IS the Divine. God and the Universe\n spoke to me. It is all, always, speaking to us. And what it says\n  \n is endless\n it brings wholeness\n  \n to the precious moment. It goes away\n when one tries to pin it down, as I do. I say less and less\n  \n as I try to describe it. It is endlessly\n generative. It is good\n  \n but pitiless and merciful. It demands of us\n that we arrive. And now that the thinking manifests\n  \n in a way that allows\n for union and a bridge, in a way that avoids\n  \n easy condemnation, a thinking that reveals\n the links toward light\n  \n in motion, a primordial\n form of being\n  \n in a new world that needs no one\n to believe in it, a vast chasm\n  \n in what a bureaucracy of thought\n tries to pin us down with, the hole in time\n  \n that allows us to be free\n is here, we know it. All of us\n  \n can see through delusion. There is no road\n in the aftermath of earthquakes, no need for the time\n  \n to extinguish the elements, no person\n locked to your heart\n  \n in the morning, no water to drink\n without thirst, no air is necessary to breathe\n  \n under the water of seeing, no\n need for the earth to do anything\n  \n other than revolve, in this\n new light. Space\n  \n undoes our links\n to the immovable. We deliver\n  \n the undone to the plains\n and see what the harvest\n  \n will fill with seed. The whole\n does not exist\n  \n within outlines. All we can do\n is move to it. The music\n  \n is unheard of\n in this world. It exists\n  \n without origin. It is otherworldly,\n primordial, and gentle. It vibrates,\n  \n equally, in the Lamb, in\n the Lotus, in\n  \n the stones--there is no place\n unknown to it. It is\n  \n music, and nothing more,\n and nothing less. It is that\n  \n everywhere possible. It is harmonious\n infinitely, and allows for any sound. To some\n  \n it might seem like noise, but that\n is only the part. To achieve it\n  \n one need only listen. I cannot always\n hear it, but I have\n  \n heard it. And now\n in my new mind, I listen for it\n  \n undaunted and silent. I feel it filling\n my body with love. Sometimes\n  \n I have horrific thoughts. But I am learning\n that these are but strong notes\n  \n in the fullness\n of the music\n  \n of my new mind. I can't always hear the song,\n but I feel it now. It makes all context\n  \n vast. I will receive it\n as long as it is here. I will not push\n  \n one way or the other with it. It is a fullness\n and does not want to be made\n  \n into a force. It is a force\n without me, and only to the degree\n  \n to which this is true. No longer being able\n to receive it\n  \n will imply a failure\n of my imagination, of my ethics,\n  \n and my spirit. There is no way\n to hold on to it. It serves\n  \n no one. And it includes us all. To continue to receive it\n more fully\n  \n I grow. This implies\n the world. It implies clarity. It implies\n  \n motion. But it rests motionlessly. If I have a softness in my voice\n it is caused by this music. When I don't\n  \n I feel less. My voice can be loud\n to receive it, but this loudness\n  \n cannot be yoked\n in outlines. There is nothing I can do.\n  \n There is nothing to expect. I can only\n let it go. And I can only be afraid\n  \n of the horror of my thoughts\n without this music. But now that I know\n  \n a taste of it, I have\n hope. Good people\n  \n feed it. I haven't always known\n what to do with it and others. But now\n  \n I am a little less confused\n about this. This is due\n  \n to Buddhism, the little that I know\n of its practice. And to love. But it does not stop\n  \n at my experience. I am ignorant\n and cannot offer knowledge. Except this\n  \n music\n does not require knowledge. I'm not sure\n  \n what it requires. It requires\n to be received, but does not need us. Is there a pact\n  \n between humanity\n and God? I don't know. Is there a God?\n  \n I don't know. I'm not sure the question\n is enough on its own. Or maybe it is, if God\n  \n is not limited by concept. And concept\n seems to be only a note in this song. Problems\n  \n feed it. \"Love\n is the absence of fear.\" And \"love\n  \n believes all things,\n yet is never deceived.\" I aim\n  \n to see through my delusions. I aim\n to be one of many, a small voice\n  \n in the song of the world. I rest\n in silence\n  \n as I always have. \"To have a view\n as vast as the sky\n  \n and as fine\n as a grain of sand.\" All beings\n  \n want to be loved\n and to be free\n  \n from suffering. We strive\n diligently\n  \n to learn the vast expanse\n and the laser pointed focus\n  \n of this gift. Remember that light\n makes us. And that in this\n  \n new world, more and more\n is made of light. And if that is the case,\n  \n we move to move\n the light of the world. Someday,\n  \n perhaps, we will move\n the light\n  \n of the computer world. Only the compassionate\n and true\n  \n will be able to do so. Because only they\n can be selfless enough\n  \n to let it move through them. I am not there\n to move it\n  \n but I saw this. Long ago. Briefly. I was offered\n a glimpse. It is utterly simple and beyond\n  \n thought. There is hope. Intention\n is a thought. So one\n  \n sees. I cannot tangle\n myself\n  \n in the line. But only to bridge. That is part of why\n it will all move. But I cannot wait\n  \n until that is possible\n to become. I can wait\n  \n eternally and actively in the world\n to remain\n  \n still. With the calm and expansive\n link\n  \n that allows us to live, so preciously\n together, I see through\n  \n the trouble that startles me, every moment\n and allow the seeing\n  \n of my inner eye\n to burn through it. I do not remember\n  \n what Zyprexa was like any longer. Except that it seems\n I have more to work with now, with my mind. And these\n  \n words are plain, so as to be careful in this new place. I see\n that they do not break open my heart, as I read. And for that\n  \n I relinquish this poem, and allow it to be only\n a mark on the road to further inquiry. I allow it to see\n  \n as I have made a vow to bridge, that my life\n aims to be whole, even in the face of potential\n  \n catastrophes, I grow more and more\n to accept death as it arrives, to allow it to soften me,\n  \n and to transform me as I have been transformed through Geodon, only\n to know that there is an isthmus, and that it is eternal. Only that there is one\n  \n heart to allow myself to speak\n in the storms of tribulation, as one speaks\n  \n to allow the teamwork of the fabric of need\n of the bird malingerer to see this\n  \n in the aftermath of one who has died. Like a bicycle never once\n together enough to ride, I see this word here, again, to the removal\n  \n of a people, to the homeland of union and pace, to the isthmus\n of a double link, one ocean to another, one continent\n  \n to another, to the only union (even as it may be erased in my history), the place\n of one heart to allow the song to continue through conflict\n  \n as she saw it then, one time, far away, when I hadn't known yet, that this\n would be timeless. And there is one to it there to see it there, to allow\n  \n it there to become and to see there as one is there to see\n and to allow one to arrive with it there and to see, and to be one with it\n  \n there as one is there to be with it. And to see there as one is there to believe\n as it is one to believe it there\n  \n and to see it there as one with the soil and the air and the light and rain\n and to be there with one to be there one with it there once again, and to see it there\n  \n and to believe as there is one there to believe it there again and to see. And to see\n there as one is there to believe as it is there again\n  \n and to see there as one is there to arrive and to be with it\n there and to see it there once again and to see it there again\n  \n and to believe as there is one to it again and to see and to hold\n and to see it there and to hold\n  \n being that nothing holds\n dissolving\n  \nwritten in transition from Zyprexa 10 mg/night to Geodon 160 mg/night--December 23, 2009 (transition started), January 2, 2010 (poem started)",

It was launched by Iran in July 1982 near Basra and featured the use of human wave attacks in one of the largest land battles since World War II. Aftermath: The operation was the first of many disastrous offensives which cost thousands of lives on both sides. This one in general boosted the casualty limit up to 80,000 killed, 200,000 wounded, and 45,000 captured. In retrospect, the Iranians lacked effective command and control, air support, and logistics to sustain an attack in the first place. Saddam Hussein offered several ceasefire attempts in the following year, none of which were accepted by the Revolutionary regime.

Three Iranian armored regiments advanced towards Iraqi forces who had invaded Iranian territory between the cities of Ahvaz, Susangerd, and Dezful. The Iraqi forces were alerted to this movement and feigned a withdrawal. The Iraqis formed three armored regiments into a three-sided box ambush. The Iranians blundered into the ambush and the two tank forces battled for four days in a sea of mud. The battle had been ordered by President Abdulhassan Banisadr who was hoping that a victory might shore up his deteriorating political position; instead the failure of the offensive helped to hasten his fall.

The hundredth time\n\n your father says, But she hated violence,\n why would she marry a guy like that?--\n don't waste your breath explaining, again,\n\n how abusers wait, are patient, that they\n don't beat you on the first date, sometimes\n not even the first few years of a marriage.\n\n Keep an impassive face whenever you hear\nStand By Your Man, and let go your rage\n when you recall those words were advice\n\n given your mother. Try to forget the first\n trial, before she was dead, when the charge\n was only attempted murder; don't belabor\n\n the thinking or the sentence that allowed\n her ex-husband's release a year later, or\n the juror who said, It's a domestic issue--\n\nthey should work it out themselves. Just\n breathe when, after you read your poems\n about grief, a woman asks, Do you think\n\n your mother was weak for men? Learn\n to ignore subtext. Imagine a thought-\n cloud above your head, dark and heavy\n\n with the words you cannot say; let silence\n rain down. Remember you were told,\n by your famous professor, that you should\n\n write about something else, unburden\n yourself of the death of your mother and\njust pour your heart out in the poems.\n\n Ask yourself what's in your heart, that\n reliquary--blood locket and seedbed--and\n contend with what it means, the folk saying\n\n you learned from a Korean poet in Seoul:\n that one does not bury the mother's body\n in the ground but in the chest, or--like you --\n\n you carry her corpse on your back.",

        "Elegy [\"I think by now the river must be thick\"]": "For my father\n\n\n\nI think by now the river must be thick\n         with salmon. Late August, I imagine it\n\n as it was that morning: drizzle needling\n         the surface, mist at the banks like a net\n\n settling around us -- everything damp\n         and shining. That morning, awkward\n\n and heavy in our hip waders, we stalked\n         into the current and found our places --\n\n you upstream a few yards and out\n         far deeper. You must remember how\n\n the river seeped in over your boots\n         and you grew heavier with that defeat.\n\n All day I kept turning to watch you, how\n         first you mimed our guide's casting\n\n then cast your invisible line, slicing the sky\n         between us; and later, rod in hand, how\n\n you tried -- again and again -- to find\n         that perfect arc, flight of an insect\n\n skimming the river's surface. Perhaps\n         you recall I cast my line and reeled in\n\n two small trout we could not keep.\n         Because I had to release them, I confess,\n\n I thought about the past -- working\n         the hooks loose, the fish writhing\n\n in my hands, each one slipping away\n         before I could let go.

Against a backdrop, blue\n\n and ethereal, a wash of paint that seems\n         to hold him in relief, Jefferson gazes out\n across the centuries, his lips fixed as if\n\n he's just uttered some final word.\n         The first time I saw the painting, I listened\n as my father explained the contradictions:\n  \n how Jefferson hated slavery, though -- out \n         of necessity, my father said -- had to own\n slaves; that his moral philosophy meant\n  \n he could not have fathered those children:\n         would have been impossible, my father said.\n For years we debated the distance between\n\n word and deed. I'd follow my father from book\n         to book, gathering citations, listening\n as he named -- like a field guide to Virginia --\n\n each flower and tree and bird as if to prove\n         a man's pursuit of knowledge is greater\n than his shortcomings, the limits of his vision.\n\n I did not know then the subtext\n         of our story, that my father could imagine\n Jefferson's words made flesh in my flesh --\n  \nthe improvement of the blacks in body\n         and mind, in the first instance of their mixture\n with the whites -- or that my father could believe\n\n he'd made me better. When I think of this now,\n         I see how the past holds us captive,\n its beautiful ruin etched on the mind's eye:\n\n my young father, a rough outline of the old man\n         he's become, needing to show me\n the better measure of his heart, an equation\n\n writ large at Monticello. That was years ago.\n         Now, we take in how much has changed:\n talk of Sally Hemings, someone asking,\n\nHow white was she? -- parsing the fractions\n        as if to name what made her worthy \nof Jefferson's attentions: a near-white,\n\nquadroon mistress, not a plain black slave.\n        Imagine stepping back into the past, \nour guide tells us then -- and I can't resist\n\nwhispering to my father: This is where\n        we split up. I'll head around to the back. \nWhen he laughs, I know he's grateful\n\nI've made a joke of it, this history\n        that links us -- white father, black daughter -- \neven as it renders us other to each other.",

It is tobacco to us, this side of her leg. We put it in our samovar and make tea of it. You see the stuff has possibilities. You think you are opposing the rich but the truth is you're turning toward authority yourself, to say nothing of religion. No, I do not say it means nothing. Why everything is nicely adjusted to our moods. But I would rather describe to you what I saw in the kitchen last night--overlook the girl a moment: there over the sink (1) this saucepan holds all, (2) this colander holds most, (3) this wire sieve lets most go and (4) this funnel holds nothing. You appreciate the progression. What need then to be always laughing? Quit phrase making--that is, not of course--but you will understand me or if not--why--come to breakfast sometime around evening on the fourth of January any year you please; always be punctual where eating is concerned.\n ________________\n       My little son's improvisations exceed min: a round stone to him's a loaf of bread or \"this hen could lay a dozen golden eggs.\" Birds fly about his bedstead; giants lean over him with hungry jaws; bears roam the farm by summer and are killed and quartered at a thought. There are interminable stories at eating time full of bizarre imagery, true grotesques, pigs that change to dogs in the telling, cows that sing, roosters that become mountains and oceans that fill a soup plate. There are groans and growls, dun clouds and sunshine mixed in a huge phantasmagoria that never rests, never ceased to unfold into--the day's poor little happenings. Not that alone. He has music which I have not. His tunes follow no scale, no rhythm--alone the mood in odd ramblings up and down, over and over with a rigor of invention that rises beyond the power to follow except in some more obvious flight. Never have I heard so crushing a critique as those desolate inventions, involved half-hymns, after his first visit to a Christian Sunday school.  \n    3\n       This song is to Phyllis! By this deep snow I know it's springtime, not ring time! Good God no! The screaming brat's a sheep bleating, the rattling crib-side sheep shaking a bush. We are young! We are happy! says Colin. What's an icy room and the sun not up? This song is to Phyllis. Reproduction lets death in, says Joyce. Rot, say I. to Phyllis this song is!  \n________________\n       That which is known has value only by virtue of the dark. This cannot be otherwise. A thing known passes out of the mind into the muscles, the will is quit of it, save only when set into vibration by the forces of darkness opposed to it. ",
        "Kora in Hell: Improvisations XIV": "XIV 1\n       The brutal Lord of All will rip us from each other--leave the one to suffer here alone. No need belief in god or hell to postulate that much. The dance: hands touching, leaves touching--eyes looking, clouds rising--lips touching, cheeks touching, arm about . . . Sleep. Heavy head, heavy arm, heavy dream--: Of Ymir's flesh the earth was made and of his thoughts were all the gloomy clouds created. Oya!  \n________________\n       Out of bitterness itself the clear wine of the imagination will be pressed and the dance prosper thereby.  \n2\n       To you! whoever you are, wherever you are! (But I know where you are!) There's Durer's \"Nemesis\" naked on her sphere over the little town by the river--except she's too old. There's a dancing burgess by Tenier and Villon's maitresse--after he'd gone bald and was skin pocked and toothless: she that had him ducked in the sewage drain. Then there's that miller's daughter of \"buttocks broad and breastes high.\" Something of Nietzsche, something of the good Samaritan, something of the devil himself,--can cut a caper of a fashion, my fashion! Hey you, the dance! Squat. leap. Hips to the left. Chin--ha!--sideways! Stand up, stand up ma bonne! you'll break my backbone. So again!--and so forth till we're sweat soaked.  \n________________\n       Some fools once were listening to a poet reading his poem. It so happened that the words of the thing spoke of gross matters of the everyday world such as are never much hidden from a quick eye. Out of these semblances, and borrowing certain members from fitting masterpieces of antiquity, the poet began piping up his music, simple fellow, thinking to please his listeners. But they getting the whole matter sadly muddled in their minds made such a confused business of listening that not only were they not pleased at the poet's exertions but no sooner had he done than they burst out against him with violent imprecations.  \n3\n       It's all one. Richard worked years to conquer the descending cadence, idiotic sentimentalist. Ha, for happiness! This tore the dress in ribbons from her maid's back and not spared the nails either; wild anger spit from her pinched eyes! This is the better part. Or a child under a table to be dragged out coughing and biting, eyes glittering evilly. I'll have it my way! Nothing is any pleasure but misery and brokenness. THIS is the only up-cadence. This is where the secret rolls over and opens its eyes. Bitter words spoken to a child ripple in morning light! Boredom from a bedroom doorway thrills with anticipation! The complaints of an old man dying piecemeal are starling chirrups. Coughs go singing on springtime paths across a field; corruption picks strawberries and slow warping of the mind, blacking the deadly walls--counted and recounted--rolls in the grass and shouts ecstatically. All is solved! The moaning and dull sobbing of infants sets blood tingling and eyes ablaze to listen. Speed sings in the heels at long nights tossing on coarse sheets with bruning sockets staring into the black. Dance! Sing! Coil and uncoil! Whip yourselves about! Shout the deliverance! An old woman has infected her blossomy grand-daughter with a blood illness that every two weeks drives the mother into hidden songs of agony, the pad-footed mirage of creeping death for music. The face muscles keep pace. Then a darting about the compass in a tarantelle that wears flesh from bones. Here is dancing! The mind in tatters. And so the music wistfully takes the lead. Ay de mi, Juana la Loca, reina de Espana, esa esta tu canta, reina mia!",

See! the hearse leads. I begin with          a design for a hearse. For Christ's sake          not black -- nor white either --          and not polished! Let it be weathered --          like a farm wagon -- with gilt wheels          (this could be applied fresh          at small expense) or no wheels at all: a rough dray to          drag over the ground.  Knock the glass out! My God-glass,          my townspeople! For what purpose?          Is it for the dead to look out or          for us to see how well he is housed          or to see the flowers or          the lack of them -- or what? To keep the rain          and snow from him? He will have a          heavier rain soon: pebbles and dirt          and what not. Let there be no glass -- and no upholstery          phew! and no little          brass rollers and small easy wheels          on the bottom -- my townspeople          what are you thinking of?  A rough          plain hearse then with gilt wheels          and no top at all. On this          the coffin lies by its own weight.                    No wreathes please -- especially no          hot house flowers. Some common memento          is better, something he prized          and is known by: his old clothes --          a few books perhaps -- God knows what!          You realize how we are          about these things my townspeople -- something will be found --          anything even flowers          if he had come to that. So much for          the hearse.  For heaven's sake though          see to the driver! Take off          the silk hat! In fact that's no place          at all for him -- up there          unceremoniously dragging our friend out          to his own dignity! Bring him down --          bring him down! Low and inconspicuous!          I'd not have him ride on the wagon at all --          damn him -- the undertaker's          understrapper! Let him hold          the reins and walk          at the side and inconspicuously          too!  Then briefly          as to yourselves: Walk behind --          as they do in France, seventh class, or          if you ride Hell take curtains!          Go with some show of inconvenience;          sit openly -- to the weather          as to grief. Or do you think          you can shut grief in? What -- from us?          We who have perhaps nothing to lose?          Share with us share with us --          it will be money in your pockets.                               Go now I think you are          ready.",

Precious, she said, her breath\n smoking in the cold. Precious in winter's first lavender\n  \n not-quite-light--and you could smell it, the faintest acrid hint\n of ash, a crispness calling you from bed. You could watch her\n  \n cap it in a chicory coffee can to stack among others, back bent\n from a long-gone fever. For the garden in spring, she said."

        "Renascence": "All I could see from where I stood Was three long mountains and a wood; I turned and looked another way, And saw three islands in a bay. So with my eyes I traced the line  Of the horizon, thin and fine, Straight around till I was come Back to where I'd started from;  And all I saw from where I stood Was three long mountains and a wood.   Over these things I could not see; These were the things that bounded me; And I could touch them with my hand, Almost, I thought, from where I stand. And all at once things seemed so small My breath came short, and scarce at all.   But, sure, the sky is big, I said; Miles and miles above my head; So here upon my back I'll lie And look my fill into the sky. And so I looked, and, after all, The sky was not so very tall. The sky, I said, must somewhere stop, And--sure enough!--I see the top!  The sky, I thought, is not so grand; I 'most could touch it with my hand! And reaching up my hand to try, I screamed to feel it touch the sky.   I screamed, and--lo!--Infinity Came down and settled over me; Forced back my scream into my chest, Bent back my arm upon my breast, And, pressing of the Undefined The definition on my mind, Held up before my eyes a glass Through which my shrinking sight did pass Until it seemed I must behold Immensity made manifold; Whispered to me a word whose sound Deafened the air for worlds around, And brought unmuffled to my ears The gossiping of friendly spheres, The creaking of the tented sky, The ticking of Eternity.   I saw and heard, and knew at last The How and Why of all things, past, And present, and forevermore. The Universe, cleft to the core, Lay open to my probing sense That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence But could not,--nay! But needs must suck At the great wound, and could not pluck My lips away till I had drawn All venom out.--Ah, fearful pawn! For my omniscience paid I toll In infinite remorse of soul.   All sin was of my sinning, all Atoning mine, and mine the gall Of all regret. Mine was the weight  Of every brooded wrong, the hate That stood behind each envious thrust, Mine every greed, mine every lust.   And all the while for every grief, Each suffering, I craved relief With individual desire,-- Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire About a thousand people crawl; Perished with each,--then mourned for all!   A man was starving in Capri; He moved his eyes and looked at me; I felt his gaze, I heard his moan, And knew his hunger as my own. I saw at sea a great fog bank Between two ships that struck and sank; A thousand screams the heavens smote; And every scream tore through my throat.   No hurt I did not feel, no death That was not mine; mine each last breath That, crying, met an answering cry From the compassion that was I. All suffering mine, and mine its rod; Mine, pity like the pity of God.   Ah, awful weight! Infinity Pressed down upon the finite Me! My anguished spirit, like a bird, Beating against my lips I heard; Yet lay the weight so close about There was no room for it without. And so beneath the weight lay I And suffered death, but could not die.   Long had I lain thus, craving death, When quietly the earth beneath Gave way, and inch by inch, so great At last had grown the crushing weight, Into the earth I sank till I Full six feet under ground did lie, And sank no more,--there is no weight Can follow here, however great. From off my breast I felt it roll, And as it went my tortured soul Burst forth and fled in such a gust That all about me swirled the dust.   Deep in the earth I rested now; Cool is its hand upon the brow And soft its breast beneath the head Of one who is so gladly dead. And all at once, and over all The pitying rain began to fall; I lay and heard each pattering hoof Upon my lowly, thatched roof, And seemed to love the sound far more Than ever I had done before. For rain it hath a friendly sound To one who's six feet underground; And scarce the friendly voice or face: A grave is such a quiet place.   The rain, I said, is kind to come And speak to me in my new home. I would I were alive again To kiss the fingers of the rain, To drink into my eyes the shine Of every slanting silver line, To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze From drenched and dripping apple-trees. For soon the shower will be done, And then the broad face of the sun Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth Until the world with answering mirth Shakes joyously, and each round drop Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top.   How can I bear it; buried here, While overhead the sky grows clear And blue again after the storm? O, multi-colored, multiform, Beloved beauty over me, That I shall never, never see Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold, That I shall never more behold! Sleeping your myriad magics through, Close-sepulchred away from you! O God, I cried, give me new birth, And put me back upon the earth! Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd And let the heavy rain, down-poured In one big torrent, set me free, Washing my grave away from me!   I ceased; and through the breathless hush That answered me, the far-off rush Of herald wings came whispering Like music down the vibrant string Of my ascending prayer, and--crash! Before the wild wind's whistling lash The startled storm-clouds reared on high And plunged in terror down the sky, And the big rain in one black wave Fell from the sky and struck my grave.   I know not how such things can be; I only know there came to me A fragrance such as never clings To aught save happy living things; A sound as of some joyous elf Singing sweet songs to please himself, And, through and over everything, A sense of glad awakening. The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear, Whispering to me I could hear; I felt the rain's cool finger-tips Brushed tenderly across my lips, Laid gently on my sealed sight, And all at once the heavy night Fell from my eyes and I could see,-- A drenched and dripping apple-tree, A last long line of silver rain, A sky grown clear and blue again. And as I looked a quickening gust Of wind blew up to me and thrust Into my face a miracle Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,-- I know not how such things can be!-- I breathed my soul back into me.   Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I And hailed the earth with such a cry As is not heard save from a man Who has been dead, and lives again. About the trees my arms I wound;   Like one gone mad I hugged the ground; I raised my quivering arms on high; I laughed and laughed into the sky, Till at my throat a strangling sob Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb Sent instant tears into my eyes; O God, I cried, no dark disguise Can e'er hereafter hide from me Thy radiant identity!   Thou canst not move across the grass But my quick eyes will see Thee pass, Nor speak, however silently, But my hushed voice will answer Thee. I know the path that tells Thy way Through the cool eve of every day; God, I can push the grass apart And lay my finger on Thy heart!   The world stands out on either side No wider than the heart is wide; Above the world is stretched the sky,-- No higher than the soul is high. The heart can push the sea and land Farther away on either hand; The soul can split the sky in two, And let the face of God shine through. But East and West will pinch the heart That can not keep them pushed apart; And he whose soul is flat--the sky Will cave in on him by and by.",

        "On Teaching": "Then said a teacher, Speak to us of Teach-\n ing.\n     And he said:\n     No man can reveal to you aught but that\n which already lies half asleep in the dawn-\n ing of your knowledge.\n     The teacher who walks in the shadow of\n the temple, among his followers, gives not\n of his wisdom but rather of his faith and\n his lovingness.\n     If he is indeed wise he does not bid you\n enter the house of his wisdom, but rather\n leads you to the threshold of your own\n mind.\n    The astronomer may speak to you of his\n understanding of space, but he cannot give\n you his understanding.\n    The musician may sing to you of the\n rhythm which is in all space, but he cannot\n give you the ear which arrests the rhythm\n nor the voice that echoes it.\n    And he who is versed in the science of\n numbers can tell of the regions of weight\n and measure, but he cannot conduct you\n thither.\n    For the vision of one man lends not its\n wings to another man.\n    And even as each one of you stands alone\n in God's knowledge, so must each one of\n you be alone in his knowledge of God and\n in his understanding of the earth.",

I\n would have them seek.\n     For they shall find pleasure, but not her\n alone;\n     Seven are her sisters, and the least of them\n is more beautiful than pleasure.\n     Have you not heard of the man who was\n digging in the earth for roots and found a\n treasure?\n  \n     And some of your elders remember\n pleasures with regret like wrongs com-\n mitted in drunkenness.\n     But regret is the beclouding of the mind\n  and not its chastisement.\n     They should remember their pleasures with\n gratitude, as they would the harvest of a\n summer.\n     Yet if it comforts them to regret, let them\n be comforted.\n  \n     And there are among you those who are\n neither young to seek nor old to remember;\n     And in their fear of seeking and remem-\n bering they shun all pleasures, lest they\n neglect the spirit or offend against it.\n     But even in their foregoing is their\n pleasure.\n     And thus they too find a treasure though\n they dig for roots with quivering hands.\n     But tell me, who is he that can offend the\n spirit?\n     Shall the nightingale offend the stillness of\n the night, or the firefly the stars?\n     And shall your flame or your smoke\n burden the wind?\n     Think you the spirit is a still pool which\n you can trouble with a staff?\n  \n     Oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure\n you do but store the desire in the recesses\n of your being.\n     Who knows but that which seems omitted\n today, waits for tomorrow?\n     Even your body knows its heritage and\n its rightful need and will not be deceived.\n     And your body is the harp of your soul,\n     And it is yours to bring forth sweet\n music from it or confused sounds.\n  \n      And now you ask in your heart, \"How\n shall we distinguish that which is good in\n pleasure from that which is not good?\"\n      Go to your fields and your gardens, and\n you shall learn that it is the pleasure of\n the bee to gather honey of the flower,\n      But it is also the pleasure of the flower\n to yield its honey to the bee.\n      For to the bee a flower is a fountain of\n life,\n      And to the flower a bee is a messenger of\n love,\n      And to both, bee and flower, the giving\n and the receiving of pleasure is a need and\n an ecstasy.\n  \n      People of Orphalese, be in your pleas-\n ures like the flowers and the bees.",

And on a beach we saw a man picking up dead fish and tenderly putting them back into the water.\n\n\"And we cannot bathe before him,\" said my soul.  \"He is the humane philanthropist.\"\n\nAnd we passed on.\n\nThen we came where we saw a man tracing his shadow on the sand. Great waves came and erased it.  But he went on tracing it again and again.\n\n\"He is the mystic,\" said my soul, \"Let us leave him.\"\n\nAnd we walked on, till in a quiet cover we saw a man scooping up the foam and putting it into an alabaster bowl.\n\n\"He is the idealist,\" said my soul, \"Surely he must not see our nudity.\"\n\nAnd on we walked.  Suddenly we heard a voice crying, \"This is the sea.  This is the deep sea.  This is the vast and mighty sea.\" And when we reached the voice it was a man whose back was turned to the sea, and at his ear he held a shell, listening to its murmur.\n\nAnd my soul said, \"Let us pass on.  He is the realist, who turns his back on the whole he cannot grasp, and busies himself with a fragment.\"\n\nSo we passed on.  And in a weedy place among the rocks was a man with his head buried in the sand.  And I said to my soul, \"We can bath here, for he cannot see us.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said my soul, \"For he is the most deadly of them all.  He is the puritan.\"\n\nThen a great sadness came over the face of my soul, and into her voice.\n\n\"Let us go hence,\" she said, \"For there is no lonely, hidden place where we can bathe.  I would not have this wind lift my golden hair, or bare my white bosom in this air, or let the light disclose my sacred nakedness.\"\n\nThen we left that sea to seek the Greater Sea.",
        "God": "In the ancient days, when the first quiver of speech came to my lips, I ascended the holy mountain and spoke unto God, saying, \"Master, I am thy slave.  Thy hidden will is my law and I shall obey thee for ever more.\"   But God made no answer, and like a mighty tempest passed away.   And after a thousand years I ascended the holy mountain and again spoke unto God, saying, \"Creator, I am thy creation.  Out of clay hast thou fashioned me and to thee I owe mine all.\"   And God made no answer, but like a thousand swift wings passed away.   And after a thousand years I climbed the holy mountain and spoke unto God again, saying, \"Father, I am thy son.  In pity and love thou hast given me birth, and through love and worship I shall inherit thy kingdom.\"   And God made no answer, and like the mist that veils the distant hills he passed away.   And after a thousand years I climbed the sacred mountain and again spoke unto God, saying, \"My God, my aim and my fulfillment; I am thy yesterday and thou are my tomorrow.  I am thy root in the earth and thou art my flower in the sky, and together we grow before the face of the sun.\"   Then God leaned over me, and in my ears whispered words of sweetness, and even as the sea that enfoldeth a brook that runneth down to her, he enfolded me.   And when I descended to the valleys and the plains God was there also.",
        "My Friend": "My friend, I am not what I seem.  Seeming is but a garment I wear--a care-woven garment that protects me from thy questionings and thee from my negligence.   The \"I\" in me, my friend, dwells in the house of silence, and therein it shall remain for ever more, unperceived, unapproachable.   I would not have thee believe in what I say nor trust in what I do--for my words are naught but thy own thoughts in sound and my deeds thy own hopes in action.   When thou sayest, \"The wind bloweth eastward,\" I say, \"Aye it doth blow eastward\"; for I would not have thee know that my mind doth not dwell upon the wind but upon the sea.   Thou canst not understand my seafaring thoughts, nor would I have thee understand.  I would be at sea alone.   When it is day with thee, my friend, it is night with me; yet even then I speak of the noontide that dances upon the hills and of the purple shadow that steals its way across the valley; for thou canst not hear the songs of my darkness nor see my wings beating against the stars--and I fain would not have thee hear or see.  I would be with night alone.   When thou ascendest to thy Heaven I descend to my Hell--even then thou callest to me across the unbridgeable gulf, \"My companion, my comrade,\" and I call back to thee, \"My comrade, my companion\"--for I would not have thee see my Hell.  The flame would burn thy eyesight and the smoke would crowd thy nostrils.  And I love my Hell too well to have thee visit it.  I would be in Hell alone.   Thou lovest Truth and Beauty and Righteousness; and I for thy sake say it is well and seemly to love these things.  But in my heart I laught at thy love.  Yet I would not have thee see my laughter. I would laugh alone.   My friend, thou art good and cautious and wise; nay, thou art perfect--and I, too, speak with thee wisely and cautiously.  And yet I am mad.  But I mask my madness.  I would be mad alone.   My friend, thou art not my friend, but how shall I make thee understand?  My path is not thy path, yet together we walk, hand in hand.",
        "On Giving and Taking": "Once there lived a man who had a valley-full of needles.  And one day the mother of Jesus came to him and said:  \"Friend, my son's garment is torn and I must needs mend it before he goeth to the temple.  Wouldst thou not give me a needle?\"   And he gave her not a needle, but he gave her a learned discourse on Giving and Taking to carry to her son before he should go to the temple.",
        "The Fox": "A fox looked at his shadow at sunrise and said, \"I will have a camel for lunch today.\"  And all morning he went about looking for camels.  But at noon he saw his shadow again--and he said, \"A mouse will do.\"",
        "Ambition": "Three men met at a tavern table.  One was a weaver, another a carpenter and the third a ploughman.   Said the weaver, \"I sold a fine linen shroud today for two pieces of gold.  Let us have all the wine we want.\"   \"And I,\" said the carpenter, \"I sold my best coffin.  We will have a great roast with the wine.\"   \"I only dug a grave,\" said the ploughman, \"but my patron paid me double.  Let us have honey cakes too.\"   And all that evening the tavern was busy, for they called often for wine and meat and cakes.  And they were merry.   And the host rubbed his hands and smiled at his wife; for his guests were spending freely.   When they left the moon was high, and they walked along the road singing and shouting together.   The host and his wife stood in the tavern door and looked after them.   \"Ah!\" said the wife, \"these gentlemen!  So freehanded and so gay! If only they could bring us such luck every day!  Then our son need not be a tavern-keeper and work so hard.  We could educate him, and he could become a priest.\"",
        "The New Pleasure": "Last night I invented a new pleasure, and as I was giving it the first trial an angel and a devil came rushing toward my house.  They met at my door and fought with each other over my newly created pleasure; the one crying, \"It is a sin!\"--the other, \"It is a virtue!\"",
        "The Grave-Digger": "Once, as I was burying one of my dead selves, the grave-digger came by and said to me, \"Of all those who come here to bury, you alone I like.\"   Said I, \"You please me exceedingly, but why do you like me?\"   \"Because,\" said he, \"They come weeping and go weeping--you only come laughing and go laughing.\"",
        "The Blessed City": "In my youth I was told that in a certain city every one lived according to the Scriptures.   And I said, \"I will seek that city and the blessedness thereof.\" And it was far.  And I made great provision for my journey.  And after forty days I beheld the city and on the forty-first day I entered into it.   And lo! the whole company of the inhabitants had each but a single eye and but one hand.  And I was astonished and said to myself, \"Shall they of this so holy city have but one eye and one hand?\"   Then I saw that they too were astonished, for they were marveling greatly at my two hands and my two eyes.  And as they were speaking together I inquired of them saying, \"Is this indeed the Blessed City, where each man lives according to the Scriptures?\"  And they said, \"Yes, this is that city.\"   \"And what,\" said I, \"hath befallen you, and where are your right eyes and your right hands?\"   And all the people were moved.  And they said, \"Come thou and see.\"   And they took me to the temple in the midst of the city.  And in the temple I saw a heap of hands and eyes.  All withered.  Then said I, \"Alas! what conqueror hath committed this cruelty upon you?\"   And there went a murmur amongst them.  And one of their elders stood forth and said, \"This doing is of ourselves.  God hath made us conquerors over the evil that was in us.\"   And he led me to a high altar, and all the people followed.  And he showed me above the altar an inscription graven, and I read:     \"If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that the whole body should be cast into hell.  And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and cast it from thee; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.\"     Then I understood.  And I turned about to all the people and cried, \"Hath no man or woman among you two eyes or two hands?\"   And they answered me saying, \"No, not one.  There is none whole save such as are yet too young to read the Scripture and to understand its commandment.\"   And when we had come out of the temple, I straightway left that Blessed City; for I was not too young, and I could read the scripture.",
        "The Good God and the Evil God": "The Good God and the Evil God met on the mountain top.   The Good God said, \"Good day to you, brother.\"   The Evil God did not answer.   And the Good God said, \"You are in a bad humour today.\"   \"Yes,\" said the Evil God, \"for of late I have been often mistaken for you, called by your name, and treated as if I were you, and it ill-pleases me.\"   And the Good God said, \"But I too have been mistaken for you and called by your name.\"   The Evil God walked away cursing the stupidity of man.",
        "Defeat": "Defeat, my Defeat, my solitude and my aloofness; You are dearer to me than a thousand triumphs, And sweeter to my heart than all world-glory.   Defeat, my Defeat, my self-knowledge and my defiance, Through you I know that I am yet young and swift of foot And not to be trapped by withering laurels. And in you I have found aloneness And the joy of being shunned and scorned.   Defeat, my Defeat, my shining sword and shield, In your eyes I have read That to be enthroned is to be enslaved, And to be understood is to be leveled down, And to be grasped is but to reach one's fullness And like a ripe fruit to fall and be consumed.   Defeat, my Defeat, my bold companion, You shall hear my songs and my cries and my silences, And none but you shall speak to me of the beating of wings, And urging of seas, And of mountains that burn in the night, And you alone shall climb my steep and rocky soul.   Defeat, my Defeat, my deathless courage, You and I shall laugh together with the storm, And together we shall dig graves for all that die in us, And we shall stand in the sun with a will, And we shall be dangerous.",
        "Night and the Madman": "\"I am like thee, O, Night, dark and naked; I walk on the flaming path which is above my day-dreams, and whenever my foot touches earth a giant oak tree comes forth.\"   \"Nay, thou art not like me, O, Madman, for thou still lookest backward to see how large a foot-print thou leavest on the sand.\"   \"I am like thee, O, Night, silent and deep; and in the heart of my loneliness lies a Goddess in child-bed; and in him who is being born Heaven touches Hell.\"   \"Nay, thou art not like me, O, Madman, for thou shudderest yet before pain, and the song of the abyss terrifies thee.\"   \"I am like thee, O, Night, wild and terrible; for my ears are crowded with cries of conquered nations and sighs for forgotten lands.\"   \"Nay, thou art not like me, O, Madman, for thou still takest thy little-self for a comrade, and with thy monster-self thou canst not be friend.\"   \"I am like thee, O, Night, cruel and awful; for my bosom is lit by burning ships at sea, and my lips are wet with blood of slain warriors.\"   \"Nay, thou art not like me, O, Madman; for the desire for a sister-spirit is yet upon thee, and thou has not become alone unto thyself.\"   \"I am like thee, O, Night, joyous and glad; for he who dwells in my shadow is now drunk with virgin wine, and she who follows me is sinning mirthfully.\"   \"Nay, thou art not like me, O, Madman, for thy soul is wrapped in the veil of seven folds and thou holdest not thy heart in thine hand.\"   \"I am like thee, O, Night, patient and passionate; for in my breast a thousand dead lovers are buried in shrouds of withered kisses.\"   \"Yea, Madman, art thou like me?  Art thou like me?  And canst thou ride the tempest as a steed, and grasp the lightning as a sword?\"   \"Like thee, O, Night, like thee, mighty and high, and my throne is built upon heaps of fallen Gods; and before me too pass the days to kiss the hem of my garment but never to gaze at my face.\"   \"Art thou like me, child of my darkest heart?  And dost thou think my untamed thoughts and speak my vast language?\"   \"Yea, we are twin brothers, O, Night; for thou revealest space and I reveal my soul.\"",
        "Faces": "I have seen a face with a thousand countenances, and a face that was but a single countenance as if held in a mould.   I have seen a face whose sheen I could look through to the ugliness beneath, and a face whose sheen I had to lift to see how beautiful it was.   I have seen an old face much lined with nothing, and a smooth face in which all things were graven.   I know faces, because I look through the fabric my own eye weaves, and behold the reality beneath.",
        "Crucified": "I cried to men, \"I would be crucified!\"   And they said, \"Why should your blood be upon our heads?\"   And I answered, \"How else shall you be exalted except by crucifying madmen?\"   And they heeded and I was crucified.  And the crucifixion appeased me.   And when I was hanged between earth and heaven they lifted up their heads to see me.  And they were exalted, for their heads had never before been lifted.   But as they stood looking up at me one called out, \"For what art thou seeking to atone?\"   And another cried, \"In what cause dost thou sacrifice thyself?\"   And a third said, \"Thinkest thou with this price to buy world glory?\"   Then said a fourth, \"Behold, how he smiles!  Can such pain be forgiven?\"   And I answered them all, and said:   \"Remember only that I smiled.  I do not atone--nor sacrifice--nor wish for glory; and I have nothing to forgive.  I thirsted--and I besought you to give me my blood to drink.  For what is there can quench a madman's thirst but his own blood?  I was dumb--and I asked wounds of you for mouths.  I was imprisoned in your days and nights--and I sought a door into larger days and nights.   And now I go--as others already crucified have gone.  And think not we are weary of crucifixion.  For we must be crucified by larger and yet larger men, between greater earths and greater heavens.\"",
        "The Astronomer": "In the shadow of the temple my friend and I saw a blind man sitting alone.  And my friend said, \"Behold the wisest man of our land.\"   Then I left my friend and approached the blind man and greeted him. And we conversed.   After a while I said, \"Forgive my question; but since when has thou been blind?\"   \"From my birth,\" he answered.   Said I, \"And what path of wisdom followest thou?\"   Said he, \"I am an astronomer.\"   Then he placed his hand upon his breast saying, \"I watch all these suns and moons and stars.\"",
        "The Great Longing": "Here I sit between my brother the mountain and my sister the sea.   We three are one in loneliness, and the love that binds us together is deep and strong and strange.  Nay, it is deeper than my sister's depth and stronger than my brother's strength, and stranger than the strangeness of my madness.   Aeons upon aeons have passed since the first grey dawn made us visible to one another; and though we have seen the birth and the fullness and the death of many worlds, we are still eager and young.   We are young and eager and yet we are mateless and unvisited, and though we lie in unbroken half embrace, we are uncomforted.  And what comfort is there for controlled desire and unspent passion? Whence shall come the flaming god to warm my sister's bed?  And what she-torrent shall quench my brother's fire?  And who is the woman that shall command my heart?   In the stillness of the night my sister murmurs in her sleep the fire-god's unknown name, and my brother calls afar upon the cool and distant goddess.  But upon whom I call in my sleep I know not.                                              *        *         *   Here I sit between my brother the mountain and my sister the sea.

        "The Eye": "Said the Eye one day, \"I see beyond these valleys a mountain veiled with blue mist.  Is it not beautiful?\"   The Ear listened, and after listening intently awhile, said, \"But where is any mountain?  I do not hear it.\"   Then the Hand spoke and said, \"I am trying in vain to feel it or touch it, and I can find no mountain.\"   And the Nose said, \"There is no mountain, I cannot smell it.\"   Then the Eye turned the other way, and they all began to talk together about the Eye's strange delusion.  And they said, \"Something must be the matter with the Eye.\"",
        "And When My Sorrow was Born": "And when my Joy was born, I held it in my arms and stood on the house-top shouting, \"Come ye, my neighbours, come and see, for Joy this day is born unto me.  Come and behold this gladsome thing that laugheth in the sun.\"   But none of my neighbours came to look upon my Joy, and great was my astonishment.   And every day for seven moons I proclaimed my Joy from the house-top--and yet no one heeded me.  And my Joy and I were alone, unsought and unvisited.   Then my Joy grew pale and weary because no other heart but mine held its loveliness and no other lips kissed its lips.   Then my Joy died of isolation.   And now I only remember my dead Joy in remembering my dead Sorrow. But memory is an autumn leaf that murmurs a while in the wind and then is heard no more."

        "The Runaway": "Once when the snow of the year was beginning to fall,\n We stopped by a mountain pasture to say, 'Whose colt?'\n A little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall,\n The other curled at his breast. He dipped his head\n And snorted at us. And then he had to bolt.\n We heard the miniature thunder where he fled,\n And we saw him, or thought we saw him, dim and grey,\n Like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes.\n 'I think the little fellow's afraid of the snow.\n He isn't winter-broken. It isn't play\n With the little fellow at all. He's running away.\n I doubt if even his mother could tell him, \"Sakes,\n It's only weather.\" He'd think she didn't know!\n Where is his mother? He can't be out alone.'\n And now he comes again with a clatter of stone\n And mounts the wall again with whited eyes\n And all his tail that isn't hair up straight.\n He shudders his coat as if to throw off flies.\n 'Whoever it is that leaves him out so late,\n When other creatures have gone to stall and bin,\n Ought to be told to come and take him in.'",
        "The Aim Was Song": "Before man came to blow it right\n      The wind once blew itself untaught,\n And did its loudest day and night\n      In any rough place where it caught.\n  \n Man came to tell it what was wrong:\n      It hadn't found the place to blow;\n It blew too hard--the aim was song.\n      And listen--how it ought to go!\n  \n He took a little in his mouth,\n      And held it long enough for north\n To be converted into south,\n      And then by measure blew it forth.\n  \n By measure. It was word and note,\n      The wind the wind had meant to be--\n A little through the lips and throat.\n      The aim was song--the wind could see.",
        "Not to Keep": "They sent him back to her. The letter came\n Saying . . . And she could have him. And before\n She could be sure there was no hidden ill\n Under the formal writing, he was there,\n Living. They gave him back to her alive--\n How else? They are not known to send the dead--\n And not disfigured visibly. His face?\n His hands? She had to look, and ask,\n 'What was it, dear?' And she had given all\n And still she had all--they had--they the lucky!\n Wasn't she glad now? Everything seemed won,\n And all the rest for them permissible ease.\n She had to ask, 'What was it, dear?'\n  \n                                                                  'Enough\n Yet not enough.

The same\n Grim giving to do over for them both.\n She dared no more than ask him with her eyes\n How was it with him for a second trial.\n And with his eyes he asked her not to ask.\n They had given him back to her, but not to keep.",
        "Gathering Leaves": "Spades take up leaves\n No better than spoons,\n And bags full of leaves\n Are light as balloons.\n  \n I make a great noise\n Of rustling all day\n Like rabbit and deer\n Running away.\n  \n But the mountains I raise\n Elude my embrace,\n Flowing over my arms\n And into my face.\n  \n I may load and unload\n Again and again\n Till I fill the whole shed,\n And what have I then?\n  \n Next to nothing for weight,\n And since they grew duller\n From contact with earth,\n Next to nothing for color.\n  \n Next to nothing for use,\n But a crop is a crop,\n And who's to say where\n The harvest shall stop?",
        "The Need of Being Versed in Country Things": "The house had gone to bring again\n To the midnight sky a sunset glow.\n Now the chimney was all of the house that stood,\n Like a pistil after the petals go.\n  \n The barn opposed across the way,\n That would have joined the house in flame\n Had it been the will of the wind, was left\n To bear forsaken the place's name.\n  \n No more it opened with all one end\n For teams that came by the stony road\n To drum on the floor with scurrying hoofs\n And brush the mow with the summer load.\n  \n The birds that came to it through the air\n At broken windows flew out and in,\n Their murmur more like the sigh we sigh\n From too much dwelling on what has been.\n  \n Yet for them the lilac renewed its leaf,\n And the aged elm, though touched with fire;\n And the dry pump flung up an awkward arm;\n And the fence post carried a strand of wire.\n\n For them there was really nothing sad.\n But though they rejoiced in the nest they kept,\n One had to be versed in country things\n Not to believe the phoebes wept.",
        "Christmas Trees": "(A Christmas Circular Letter)\n\n\n\nThe city had withdrawn into itselfAnd left at last the country to the country;When between whirls of snow not come to lieAnd whirls of foliage not yet laid, there droveA stranger to our yard, who looked the city,Yet did in country fashion in that thereHe sat and waited till he drew us outA-buttoning coats to ask him who he was.He proved to be the city come againTo look for something it had left behindAnd could not do without and keep its Christmas.He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees;My woods--the young fir balsams like a placeWhere houses all are churches and have spires.I hadn't thought of them as Christmas Trees.I doubt if I was tempted for a momentTo sell them off their feet to go in carsAnd leave the slope behind the house all bare,Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon.I'd hate to have them know it if I was.Yet more I'd hate to hold my trees exceptAs others hold theirs or refuse for them,Beyond the time of profitable growth,The trial by market everything must come to.I dallied so much with the thought of selling.Then whether from mistaken courtesyAnd fear of seeming short of speech, or whetherFrom hope of hearing good of what was mine, I said,\"There aren't enough to be worth while.\"\"I could soon tell how many they would cut,You let me look them over.\"                                                     \"You could look.But don't expect I'm going to let you have them.\"Pasture they spring in, some in clumps too closeThat lop each other of boughs, but not a fewQuite solitary and having equal boughsAll round and round. The latter he nodded \"Yes\" to,Or paused to say beneath some lovelier one,With a buyer's moderation, \"That would do.\"I thought so too, but wasn't there to say so.We climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over,And came down on the north. He said, \"A thousand.\"\"A thousand Christmas trees!--at what apiece?\"He felt some need of softening that to me:\"A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars.\"Then I was certain I had never meantTo let him have them. Never show surprise!But thirty dollars seemed so small besideThe extent of pasture I should strip, three cents(For that was all they figured out apiece),Three cents so small beside the dollar friendsI should be writing to within the hourWould pay in cities for good trees like those,Regular vestry-trees whole Sunday SchoolsCould hang enough on to pick off enough.A thousand Christmas trees I didn't know I had!Worth three cents more to give away than sell,As may be shown by a simple calculation.Too bad I couldn't lay one in a letter.I can't help wishing I could send you one,In wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas.",
        "Birches": "When I see birches bend to left and right\n Across the lines of straighter darker trees,\n I like to think some boy's been swinging them.\n But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay\n As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them\n Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning\n After a rain. They click upon themselves\n As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored\n As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.\n Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells\n Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust--\n Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away\n You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.\n They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,\n And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed\n So low for long, they never right themselves:\n You may see their trunks arching in the woods\n Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground\n Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair\n Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.\n But I was going to say when Truth broke in\n With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm\n I should prefer to have some boy bend them\n As he went out and in to fetch the cows--\n Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,\n Whose only play was what he found himself,\n Summer or winter, and could play alone.\n One by one he subdued his father's trees\n By riding them down over and over again\n Until he took the stiffness out of them,\n And not one but hung limp, not one was left\n For him to conquer. He learned all there was\n To learn about not launching out too soon\n And so not carrying the tree away\n Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise\n To the top branches, climbing carefully\n With the same pains you use to fill a cup\n Up to the brim, and even above the brim.\n Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,\n Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.\n So was I once myself a swinger of birches.\n And so I dream of going back to be.\n It's when I'm weary of considerations,\n And life is too much like a pathless wood\n Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs\n Broken across it, and one eye is weeping\n From a twig's having lashed across it open.\n I'd like to get away from earth awhile\n And then come back to it and begin over.\n May no fate willfully misunderstand me\n And half grant what I wish and snatch me away\n Not to return. Earth's the right place for love:\n I don't know where it's likely to go better.\n I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,\n And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk\nToward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,\n But dipped its top and set me down again.\n That would be good both going and coming back.\n One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.",
        "Dust of Snow": "The way a crow\n Shook down on me\n The dust of snow\n From a hemlock tree\n\n Has given my heart\n A change of mood\n And saved some part\n Of a day I had rued.",
        "For Once, Then, Something": "Others taunt me with having knelt at well-curbs\n Always wrong to the light, so never seeing\n Deeper down in the well than where the water\n Gives me back in a shining surface picture\n Me myself in the summer heaven godlike\n Looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs.\nOnce, when trying with chin against a well-curb,\n I discerned, as I thought, beyond the picture,\n Through the picture, a something white, uncertain,\n Something more of the depths--and then I lost it.\n Water came to rebuke the too clear water.\n One drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple\n Shook whatever it was lay there at bottom,\n Blurred it, blotted it out. What was that whiteness?\n Truth? A pebble of quartz? For once, then, something.",
        "Good-by and Keep Cold": "This saying good-by on the edge of the dark\n And the cold to an orchard so young in the bark\n Reminds me of all that can happen to harm\n An orchard away at the end of the farm\n All winter, cut off by a hill from the house.\n I don't want it girdled by rabbit and mouse,\n I don't want it dreamily nibbled for browse\n By deer, and I don't want it budded by grouse.\n (If certain it wouldn't be idle to call\n I'd summon grouse, rabbit, and deer to the wall\n And warn them away with a stick for a gun.)\n I don't want it stirred by the heat of the sun.\n (We made it secure against being, I hope,\n By setting it out on a northerly slope.)\n No orchard's the worse for the wintriest storm;\n But one thing about it, it mustn't get warm.\n \"How often already you've had to be told,\n Keep cold, young orchard. Good-by and keep cold.\n Dread fifty above more than fifty below.\"\n I have to be gone for a season or so.\n My business awhile is with different trees,\n Less carefully nourished, less fruitful than these,\n And such as is done to their wood with an ax--\n Maples and birches and tamaracks.\n I wish I could promise to lie in the night\n And think of an orchard's arboreal plight\n When slowly (and nobody comes with a light)\n Its heart sinks lower under the sod.\n But something has to be left to God.",

        "Love and a Question": "A Stranger came to the door at eve,    And he spoke the bridegroom fair. He bore a green-white stick in his hand,    And, for all burden, care. He asked with the eyes more than the lips    For a shelter for the night, And he turned and looked at the road afar    Without a window light. The bridegroom came forth into the porch    With, 'Let us look at the sky, And question what of the night to be,    Stranger, you and I.'The woodbine leaves littered the yard,    The woodbine berries were blue, Autumn, yes, winter was in the wind;    'Stranger, I wish I knew.'Within, the bride in the dusk alone    Bent over the open fire, Her face rose-red with the glowing coal    And the thought of the heart's desire. The bridegroom looked at the weary road,    Yet saw but her within, And wished her heart in a case of gold    And pinned with a silver pin. The bridegroom thought it little to give    A dole of bread, a purse, A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God,    Or for the rich a curse; But whether or not a man was asked    To mar the love of two By harboring woe in the bridal house,    The bridegroom wished he knew.",
        "Mowing": "There was never a sound beside the wood but one,And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground.What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself;Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound--And that was why it whispered and did not speak.It was no dream of the gift of idle hours,Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf:Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weakTo the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers(Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake.The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make.",
        "October": "O hushed October morning mild,Thy leaves have ripened to the fall;Tomorrow's wind, if it be wild,Should waste them all.The crows above the forest call;Tomorrow they may form and go.O hushed October morning mild,Begin the hours of this day slow.Make the day seem to us less brief.Hearts not averse to being beguiled,Beguile us in the way you know.Release one leaf at break of day;At noon release another leaf;One from our trees, one far away.Retard the sun with gentle mist;Enchant the land with amethyst.Slow, slow!For the grapes' sake, if they were all,Whose leaves already are burnt with frost,Whose clustered fruit must else be lost--For the grapes' sake along the wall.",
        "'Out, Out--'": "The buzz saw snarled and rattled in the yardAnd made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood,Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it.And from there those that lifted eyes could countFive mountain ranges one behind the otherUnder the sunset far into Vermont.And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,As it ran light, or had to bear a load.And nothing happened: day was all but done.Call it a day, I wish they might have saidTo please the boy by giving him the half hourThat a boy counts so much when saved from work.His sister stood beside him in her apronTo tell them 'Supper.' At the word, the saw,As if to prove saws knew what supper meant,Leaped out at the boy's hand, or seemed to leap--He must have given the hand. However it was, Neither refused the meeting. But the hand!The boy's first outcry was a rueful laugh,As he swung toward them holding up the handHalf in appeal, but half as if to keepThe life from spilling. Then the boy saw all--Since he was old enough to know, big boyDoing a man's work, though a child at heart-- He saw all spoiled. 'Don't let him cut my hand off--The doctor, when he comes. Don't let him, sister!'So. But the hand was gone already.The doctor put him in the dark of ether.He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath.And then--the watcher at his pulse took fright.No one believed. They listened at his heart.Little--less--nothing!--and that ended it. No more to build on there. And they, since theyWere not the one dead, turned to their affairs.",
        "The Sound of Trees": "I wonder about the trees.Why do we wish to bearForever the noise of theseMore than another noiseSo close to our dwelling place?We suffer them by the dayTill we lose all measure of pace,And fixity in our joys,And acquire a listening air.They are that that talks of goingBut never gets away;And that talks no less for knowing,As it grows wiser and older,That now it means to stay.My feet tug at the floorAnd my head sways to my shoulderSometimes when I watch trees sway,From the window or the door.I shall set forth for somewhere,I shall make the reckless choiceSome day when they are in voiceAnd tossing so as to scareThe white clouds over them on.I shall have less to say,But I shall be gone.",
        "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening": "Whose woods these are I think I know.   \n His house is in the village though;   \n He will not see me stopping here   \n To watch his woods fill up with snow.   \n\n My little horse must think it queer   \n To stop without a farmhouse near   \n Between the woods and frozen lake   \n The darkest evening of the year.   \n\n He gives his harness bells a shake   \n To ask if there is some mistake.   \n The only other sound's the sweep   \n Of easy wind and downy flake.   \n\n The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   \n But I have promises to keep,   \n And miles to go before I sleep,   \n And miles to go before I sleep.",
        "Mending Wall": "Something there is that doesn't love a wall,\n That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,\n And spills the upper boulders in the sun;\n And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.\n The work of hunters is another thing:\n I have come after them and made repair\n Where they have left not one stone on a stone,\n But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,\n To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,\n No one has seen them made or heard them made,\n But at spring mending-time we find them there.\n I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;\n And on a day we meet to walk the line\n And set the wall between us once again.\n We keep the wall between us as we go.\n To each the boulders that have fallen to each.\n And some are loaves and some so nearly balls\n We have to use a spell to make them balance:\n 'Stay where you are until our backs are turned!'\n We wear our fingers rough with handling them.\n Oh, just another kind of out-door game,\n One on a side. It comes to little more:\n There where it is we do not need the wall:\n He is all pine and I am apple orchard.\n My apple trees will never get across\n And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.\n He only says, 'Good fences make good neighbors.'\n Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder\n If I could put a notion in his head:\n'Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it\n Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.\n Before I built a wall I'd ask to know\n What I was walling in or walling out,\n And to whom I was like to give offense.\n Something there is that doesn't love a wall,\n That wants it down.' I could say 'Elves' to him,\n But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather\n He said it for himself. I see him there\n Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top\n In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.\n He moves in darkness as it seems to me,\n Not of woods only and the shade of trees.\n He will not go behind his father's saying,\n And he likes having thought of it so well\n He says again, 'Good fences make good neighbors.'",

The view was all in lines\nStraight up and down of tall slim trees\nToo much alike to mark or name a place by\nSo as to say for certain I was here\nOr somewhere else: I was just far from home.\nA small bird flew before me. He was careful\nTo put a tree between us when he lighted,\nAnd say no word to tell me who he was\nWho was so foolish as to think what he thought.\nHe thought that I was after him for a feather--\nThe white one in his tail; like one who takes\nEverything said as personal to himself.\nOne flight out sideways would have undeceived him.\nAnd then there was a pile of wood for which\nI forgot him and let his little fear\nCarry him off the way I might have gone,\nWithout so much as wishing him good-night.\nHe went behind it to make his last stand.\nIt was a cord of maple, cut and split\nAnd piled--and measured, four by four by eight.\nAnd not another like it could I see.\nNo runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.\nAnd it was older sure than this year's cutting,\nOr even last year's or the year's before.\nThe wood was gray and the bark warping off it\nAnd the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis\nHad wound strings round and round it like a bundle.\nWhat held it though on one side was a tree\nStill growing, and on one a stake and prop,\nThese latter about to fall. I thought that only\nSomeone who lived in turning to fresh tasks\nCould so forget his handiwork on which\nHe spent himself, the labor of his ax,\nAnd leave it there far from a useful fireplace\nTo warm the frozen swamp as best it could\nWith the slow smokeless burning of decay."

As such, the Socrates\n Of snails, musician of pears, principium\n And lex. Sed quaeritur: is this same wig\n Of things, this nincompated pedagogue,\n Preceptor to the sea? Crispin at sea\n Created, in his day, a touch of doubt.\n An eye most apt in gelatines and jupes,\n Berries of villages, a barber's eye,\n An eye of land, of simple salad-beds,\n Of honest quilts, the eye of Crispin, hung\n On porpoises, instead of apricots,\n And on silentious porpoises, whose snouts\n Dibbled in waves that were mustachios,\n Inscrutable hair in an inscrutable world.\n\n One eats one pate, even of salt, quotha.\n It was not so much the lost terrestrial,\n The snug hibernal from that sea and salt,\n That century of wind in a single puff.\n What counted was mythology of self,\n Blotched out beyond unblotching. Crispin,\n The lutanist of fleas, the knave, the thane,\n The ribboned stick, the bellowing breeches, cloak\n Of China, cap of Spain, imperative haw\n Of hum, inquisitorial botanist,\n And general lexicographer of mute\n And maidenly greenhorns, now beheld himself,\n A skinny sailor peering in the sea-glass.\n What word split up in clickering syllables\n And storming under multitudinous tones\n Was name for this short-shanks in all that brunt?\n Crispin was washed away by magnitude.\n The whole of life that still remained in him\n Dwindled to one sound strumming in his ear,\n Ubiquitous concussion, slap and sigh,\n Polyphony beyond his baton's thrust.\n\n Could Crispin stem verboseness in the sea,\n The old age of a watery realist,\n Triton, dissolved in shifting diaphanes\n Of blue and green? A wordy, watery age\n That whispered to the sun's compassion, made\n A convocation, nightly, of the sea-stars,\n And on the cropping foot-ways of the moon\n Lay grovelling. Triton incomplicate with that\n Which made him Triton, nothing left of him,\n Except in faint, memorial gesturings,\n That were like arms and shoulders in the waves,\n Here, something in the rise and fall of wind\n That seemed hallucinating horn, and here,\n A sunken voice, both of remembering\n And of forgetfulness, in alternate strain.\n Just so an ancient Crispin was dissolved.\n The valet in the tempest was annulled.\n Bordeaux to Yucatan, Havana next,\n And then to Carolina. Simple jaunt.\n Crispin, merest minuscule in the gates,\n Dejected his manner to the turbulence.\n The salt hung on his spirit like a frost,\n The dead brine melted in him like a dew\n Of winter, until nothing of himself\n Remained, except some starker, barer self\n In a starker, barer world, in which the sun\n Was not the sun because it never shone\n With bland complaisance on pale parasols,\n Beetled, in chapels, on the chaste bouquets.\n Against his pipping sounds a trumpet cried\n Celestial sneering boisterously. Crispin\n Became an introspective voyager.\n\n Here was the veritable ding an sich, at last,\n Crispin confronting it, a vocable thing,\n But with a speech belched out of hoary darks\n Noway resembling his, a visible thing,\n And excepting negligible Triton, free\n From the unavoidable shadow of himself\n That lay elsewhere around him. Severance\n Was clear. The last distortion of romance\n Forsook the insatiable egotist. The sea\n Severs not only lands but also selves.\n Here was no help before reality.\n Crispin beheld and Crispin was made new.\n The imagination, here, could not evade,\n In poems of plums, the strict austerity\n Of one vast, subjugating, final tone.\n The drenching of stale lives no more fell down.\n What was this gaudy, gusty panoply?\n Out of what swift destruction did it spring?\n It was caparison of mind and cloud\n And something given to make whole among\n The ruses that were shattered by the large.\n  \n  \n\n                               ii\nConcerning the Thunderstorms of Yucatan\n\n In Yucatan, the Maya sonneteers\n Of the Caribbean amphitheatre,\n In spite of hawk and falcon, green toucan\n And jay, still to the night-bird made their plea,\n As if raspberry tanagers in palms,\n High up in orange air, were barbarous.\n But Crispin was too destitute to find\n In any commonplace the sought-for aid.\n He was a man made vivid by the sea,\n A man come out of luminous traversing,\n Much trumpeted, made desperately clear,\n Fresh from discoveries of tidal skies,\n To whom oracular rockings gave no rest.\n Into a savage color he went on.\n\n How greatly had he grown in his demesne,\n This auditor of insects! He that saw\n The stride of vanishing autumn in a park\n By way of decorous melancholy; he\n That wrote his couplet yearly to the spring,\n As dissertation of profound delight,\n Stopping, on voyage, in a land of snakes,\n Found his vicissitudes had much enlarged\n His apprehension, made him intricate\n In moody rucks, and difficult and strange\n In all desires, his destitution's mark.\n He was in this as other freemen are,\n Sonorous nutshells rattling inwardly.\n His violence was for aggrandizement\n And not for stupor, such as music makes\n For sleepers halfway waking. He perceived\n That coolness for his heat came suddenly,\n And only, in the fables that he scrawled\n With his own quill, in its indigenous dew,\n Of an aesthetic tough, diverse, untamed,\n Incredible to prudes, the mint of dirt,\n Green barbarism turning paradigm.\n Crispin foresaw a curious promenade\n Or, nobler, sensed an elemental fate,\n And elemental potencies and pangs,\n And beautiful barenesses as yet unseen,\n Making the most of savagery of palms,\n Of moonlight on the thick, cadaverous bloom\n That yuccas breed, and of the panther's tread.\n The fabulous and its intrinsic verse\n Came like two spirits parlaying, adorned\n In radiance from the Atlantic coign,\n For Crispin and his quill to catechize.\n But they came parlaying of such an earth,\n So thick with sides and jagged lops of green,\n So intertwined with serpent-kin encoiled\n Among the purple tufts, the scarlet crowns,\n Scenting the jungle in their refuges,\n So streaked with yellow, blue and green and red\n In beak and bud and fruity gobbet-skins,\n That earth was like a jostling festival\n Of seeds grown fat, too juicily opulent,\n Expanding in the gold's maternal warmth.\n So much for that. The affectionate emigrant found\n A new reality in parrot-squawks.\n Yet let that trifle pass. Now, as this odd\n Discoverer walked through the harbor streets\n Inspecting the cabildo, the facade\n Of the cathedral, making notes, he heard\n A rumbling, west of Mexico, it seemed,\n Approaching like a gasconade of drums.\n The white cabildo darkened, the facade,\n As sullen as the sky, was swallowed up\n In swift, successive shadows, dolefully.\n The rumbling broadened as it fell. The wind,\n Tempestuous clarion, with heavy cry,\n Came bluntly thundering, more terrible\n Than the revenge of music on bassoons.\n Gesticulating lightning, mystical,\n Made pallid flitter. Crispin, here, took flight.\n An annotator has his scruples, too.\n He knelt in the cathedral with the rest,\n This connoisseur of elemental fate,\n Aware of exquisite thought. The storm was one\n Of many proclamations of the kind,\n Proclaiming something harsher than he learned\n From hearing signboards whimper in cold nights\n Or seeing the midsummer artifice\n Of heat upon his pane. This was the span\n Of force, the quintessential fact, the note\n Of Vulcan, that a valet seeks to own,\n The thing that makes him envious in phrase.\n\n And while the torrent on the roof still droned\n He felt the Andean breath. His mind was free\n And more than free, elate, intent, profound\n And studious of a self possessing him,\n That was not in him in the crusty town\n From which he sailed. Beyond him, westward, lay\n The mountainous ridges, purple balustrades,\n In which the thunder, lapsing in its clap,\n Let down gigantic quavers of its voice,\n For Crispin to vociferate again.\n\n\n                                iii\n                 Approaching Carolina\n\n The book of moonlight is not written yet\n Nor half begun, but, when it is, leave room\n For Crispin, fagot in the lunar fire,\n Who, in the hubbub of his pilgrimage\n Through sweating changes, never could forget\n That wakefulness or meditating sleep,\n In which the sulky strophes willingly\n Bore up, in time, the somnolent, deep songs.\n Leave room, therefore, in that unwritten book\n For the legendary moonlight that once burned\n In Crispin's mind above a continent.\n America was always north to him,\n A northern west or western north, but north,\n And thereby polar, polar-purple, chilled\n And lank, rising and slumping from a sea\n Of hardy foam, receding flatly, spread\n In endless ledges, glittering, submerged\n And cold in a boreal mistiness of the moon.\n The spring came there in clinking pannicles\n Of half-dissolving frost, the summer came,\n If ever, whisked and wet, not ripening,\n Before the winter's vacancy returned.\n The myrtle, if the myrtle ever bloomed,\n Was like a glacial pink upon the air.\n The green palmettoes in crepuscular ice\n Clipped frigidly blue-black meridians,\n Morose chiaroscuro, gauntly drawn.\n\n How many poems he denied himself\n In his observant progress, lesser things\n Than the relentless contact he desired;\n How many sea-masks he ignored; what sounds\n He shut out from his tempering ear; what thoughts,\n Like jades affecting the sequestered bride;\n And what descants, he sent to banishment!\n Perhaps the Arctic moonlight really gave\n The liaison, the blissful liaison,\n Between himself and his environment,\n Which was, and is, chief motive, first delight,\n For him, and not for him alone. It seemed\n Elusive, faint, more mist than moon, perverse,\n Wrong as a divagation to Peking,\n To him that postulated as his theme\n The vulgar, as his theme and hymn and flight,\n A passionately niggling nightingale.\n Moonlight was an evasion, or, if not,\n A minor meeting, facile, delicate.\n\n Thus he conceived his voyaging to be\n An up and down between two elements,\n A fluctuating between sun and moon,\n A sally into gold and crimson forms,\n As on this voyage, out of goblinry,\n And then retirement like a turning back\n And sinking down to the indulgences\n That in the moonlight have their habitude.\n But let these backward lapses, if they would,\n Grind their seductions on him, Crispin knew\n It was a flourishing tropic he required\n For his refreshment, an abundant zone,\n Prickly and obdurate, dense, harmonious\n Yet with a harmony not rarefied\n Nor fined for the inhibited instruments\n Of over-civil stops. And thus he tossed\n Between a Carolina of old time,\n A little juvenile, an ancient whim,\n And the visible, circumspect presentment drawn\n From what he saw across his vessel's prow.\n\n He came. The poetic hero without palms\n Or jugglery, without regalia.\n And as he came he saw that it was spring,\n A time abhorrent to the nihilist\n Or searcher for the fecund minimum.\n The moonlight fiction disappeared. The spring,\n Although contending featly in its veils,\n Irised in dew and early fragrancies,\n Was gemmy marionette to him that sought\n A sinewy nakedness. A river bore\n The vessel inward. Tilting up his nose,\n He inhaled the rancid rosin, burly smells\n Of dampened lumber, emanations blown\n From warehouse doors, the gustiness of ropes,\n Decays of sacks, and all the arrant stinks\n That helped him round his rude aesthetic out.\n He savored rankness like a sensualist.\n He marked the marshy ground around the dock,\n The crawling railroad spur, the rotten fence,\n Curriculum for the marvellous sophomore.\n It purified. It made him see how much\n Of what he saw he never saw at all.\n He gripped more closely the essential prose\n As being, in a world so falsified,\n The one integrity for him, the one\n Discovery still possible to make,\n To which all poems were incident, unless\n That prose should wear a poem's guise at last.\n\n                             iv\n               The Idea of a Colony\n\n Nota: his soil is man's intelligence.\n That's better. That's worth crossing seas to find.\n Crispin in one laconic phrase laid bare\n His cloudy drift and planned a colony.\n Exit the mental moonlight, exit lex,\n Rex and principium, exit the whole\n Shebang. Exeunt omnes. Here was prose\n More exquisite than any tumbling verse:\n A still new continent in which to dwell.\n What was the purpose of his pilgrimage,\n Whatever shape it took in Crispin's mind,\n If not, when all is said, to drive away\n The shadow of his fellows from the skies,\n And, from their stale intelligence released,\n To make a new intelligence prevail?\n Hence the reverberations in the words\n Of his first central hymns, the celebrants\n Of rankest trivia, tests of the strength\n Of his aesthetic, his philosophy,\n The more invidious, the more desired.\n The florist asking aid from cabbages,\n The rich man going bare, the paladin\n Afraid, the blind man as astronomer,\n The appointed power unwielded from disdain.\n His western voyage ended and began.\n The torment of fastidious thought grew slack,\n Another, still more bellicose, came on.\n He, therefore, wrote his prolegomena,\n And, being full of the caprice, inscribed\n Commingled souvenirs and prophecies.\n He made a singular collation. Thus:\n The natives of the rain are rainy men.\n Although they paint effulgent, azure lakes,\n And April hillsides wooded white and pink,\n Their azure has a cloudy edge, their white\n And pink, the water bright that dogwood bears.\n And in their music showering sounds intone.\n On what strange froth does the gross Indian dote,\n What Eden sapling gum, what honeyed gore,\n What pulpy dram distilled of innocence,\n That streaking gold should speak in him\n Or bask within his images and words?\n If these rude instances impeach themselves\n By force of rudeness, let the principle\n Be plain. For application Crispin strove,\n Abhorring Turk as Esquimau, the lute\n As the marimba, the magnolia as rose.\n\n Upon these premises propounding, he\n Projected a colony that should extend\n To the dusk of a whistling south below the south.\n A comprehensive island hemisphere.\n The man in Georgia waking among pines\n Should be pine-spokesman. The responsive man,\n Planting his pristine cores in Florida,\n Should prick thereof, not on the psaltery,\n But on the banjo's categorical gut,\n Tuck tuck, while the flamingos flapped his bays.\n Sepulchral senors, bibbing pale mescal,\n Oblivious to the Aztec almanacs,\n Should make the intricate Sierra scan.\n And dark Brazilians in their cafes,\n Musing immaculate, pampean dits,\n Should scrawl a vigilant anthology,\n To be their latest, lucent paramour.\n These are the broadest instances. Crispin,\n Progenitor of such extensive scope,\n Was not indifferent to smart detail.\n The melon should have apposite ritual,\n Performed in verd apparel, and the peach,\n When its black branches came to bud, belle day,\n Should have an incantation. And again,\n When piled on salvers its aroma steeped\n The summer, it should have a sacrament\n And celebration. Shrewd novitiates\n Should be the clerks of our experience.\n\n These bland excursions into time to come,\n Related in romance to backward flights,\n However prodigal, however proud,\n Contained in their afflatus the reproach\n That first drove Crispin to his wandering.\n He could not be content with counterfeit,\n With masquerade of thought, with hapless words\n That must belie the racking masquerade,\n With fictive flourishes that preordained\n His passion's permit, hang of coat, degree\n Of buttons, measure of his salt. Such trash\n Might help the blind, not him, serenely sly.\n It irked beyond his patience. Hence it was,\n Preferring text to gloss, he humbly served\n Grotesque apprenticeship to chance event,\n A clown, perhaps, but an aspiring clown.\n There is a monotonous babbling in our dreams\n That makes them our dependent heirs, the heirs\n Of dreamers buried in our sleep, and not\n The oncoming fantasies of better birth.\n The apprentice knew these dreamers. If he dreamed\n Their dreams, he did it in a gingerly way.\n All dreams are vexing. Let them be expunged.\n But let the rabbit run, the cock declaim.\n\n Trinket pasticcio, flaunting skyey sheets,\n With Crispin as the tiptoe cozener?\n No, no: veracious page on page, exact.\n\n                                v\n                 A Nice Shady Home\n\n Crispin as hermit, pure and capable,\n Dwelt in the land. Perhaps if discontent\n Had kept him still the pricking realist,\n Choosing his element from droll confect\n Of was and is and shall or ought to be,\n Beyond Bordeaux, beyond Havana, far\n Beyond carked Yucatan, he might have come\n To colonize his polar planterdom\n And jig his chits upon a cloudy knee.\n But his emprize to that idea soon sped.\n Crispin dwelt in the land and dwelling there\n Slid from his continent by slow recess\n To things within his actual eye, alert\n To the difficulty of rebellious thought\n When the sky is blue. The blue infected will.\n It may be that the yarrow in his fields\n Sealed pensive purple under its concern.\n But day by day, now this thing and now that\n Confined him, while it cosseted, condoned,\n Little by little, as if the suzerain soil\n Abashed him by carouse to humble yet\n Attach. It seemed haphazard denouement.\n He first, as realist, admitted that\n Whoever hunts a matinal continent\n May, after all, stop short before a plum\n And be content and still be realist.\n The words of things entangle and confuse.\n The plum survives its poems. It may hang\n In the sunshine placidly, colored by ground\n Obliquities of those who pass beneath,\n Harlequined and mazily dewed and mauved\n In bloom. Yet it survives in its own form,\n Beyond these changes, good, fat, guzzly fruit.\n So Crispin hasped on the surviving form,\n For him, of shall or ought to be in is.\n\n Was he to bray this in profoundest brass\n Arointing his dreams with fugal requiems?\n Was he to company vastest things defunct\n With a blubber of tom-toms harrowing the sky?\n Scrawl a tragedian's testament? Prolong\n His active force in an inactive dirge,\n Which, let the tall musicians call and call,\n Should merely call him dead? Pronounce amen\n Through choirs infolded to the outmost clouds?\n Because he built a cabin who once planned\n Loquacious columns by the ructive sea?\n Because he turned to salad-beds again?\n Jovial Crispin, in calamitous crape?\n Should he lay by the personal and make\n Of his own fate an instance of all fate?\n What is one man among so many men?\n What are so many men in such a world?\n Can one man think one thing and think it long?\n Can one man be one thing and be it long?\n The very man despising honest quilts\n Lies quilted to his poll in his despite.\n For realists, what is is what should be.\n And so it came, his cabin shuffled up,\n His trees were planted, his duenna brought\n Her prismy blonde and clapped her in his hands,\n The curtains flittered and the door was closed.\n Crispin, magister of a single room,\n Latched up the night. So deep a sound fell down\n It was as if the solitude concealed\n And covered him and his congenial sleep.\n So deep a sound fell down it grew to be\n A long soothsaying silence down and down.\n The crickets beat their tambours in the wind,\n Marching a motionless march, custodians.\n\n In the presto of the morning, Crispin trod,\n Each day, still curious, but in a round\n Less prickly and much more condign than that\n He once thought necessary. Like Candide,\n Yeoman and grub, but with a fig in sight,\n And cream for the fig and silver for the cream,\n A blonde to tip the silver and to taste\n The rapey gouts. Good star, how that to be\n Annealed them in their cabin ribaldries!\n Yet the quotidian saps philosophers\n And men like Crispin like them in intent,\n If not in will, to track the knaves of thought.\n But the quotidian composed as his,\n Of breakfast ribands, fruits laid in their leaves,\n The tomtit and the cassia and the rose,\n Although the rose was not the noble thorn\n Of crinoline spread, but of a pining sweet,\n Composed of evenings like cracked shutters flung\n Upon the rumpling bottomness, and nights\n In which those frail custodians watched,\n Indifferent to the tepid summer cold,\n While he poured out upon the lips of her\n That lay beside him, the quotidian\n Like this, saps like the sun, true fortuner.\n For all it takes it gives a humped return\n Exchequering from piebald fiscs unkeyed.\n\n                               vi\n           And Daughters with Curls\n\n Portentous enunciation, syllable\n To blessed syllable affined, and sound\n Bubbling felicity in cantilene,\n Prolific and tormenting tenderness\n Of music, as it comes to unison,\n Forgather and bell boldly Crispin's last\n Deduction. Thrum, with a proud douceur\n His grand pronunciamento and devise.\n\n The chits came for his jigging, bluet-eyed,\n Hands without touch yet touching poignantly,\n Leaving no room upon his cloudy knee,\n Prophetic joint, for its diviner young.\n The return to social nature, once begun,\n Anabasis or slump, ascent or chute,\n Involved him in midwifery so dense\n His cabin counted as phylactery,\n Then place of vexing palankeens, then haunt\n Of children nibbling at the sugared void,\n Infants yet eminently old, then dome\n And halidom for the unbraided femes,\n Green crammers of the green fruits of the world,\n Bidders and biders for its ecstasies,\n True daughters both of Crispin and his clay.\n All this with many mulctings of the man,\n Effective colonizer sharply stopped\n In the door-yard by his own capacious bloom.\n But that this bloom grown riper, showing nibs\n Of its eventual roundness, puerile tints\n Of spiced and weathery rouges, should complex\n The stopper to indulgent fatalist\n Was unforeseen. First Crispin smiled upon\n His goldenest demoiselle, inhabitant,\n She seemed, of a country of the capuchins,\n So delicately blushed, so humbly eyed,\n Attentive to a coronal of things\n Secret and singular. Second, upon\n A second similar counterpart, a maid\n Most sisterly to the first, not yet awake\n Excepting to the motherly footstep, but\n Marvelling sometimes at the shaken sleep.\n Then third, a thing still flaxen in the light,\n A creeper under jaunty leaves. And fourth,\n Mere blusteriness that gewgaws jollified,\n All din and gobble, blasphemously pink.\n A few years more and the vermeil capuchin\n Gave to the cabin, lordlier than it was,\n The dulcet omen fit for such a house.\n The second sister dallying was shy\n To fetch the one full-pinioned one himself\n Out of her botches, hot embosomer.\n The third one gaping at the orioles\n Lettered herself demurely as became\n A pearly poetess, peaked for rhapsody.\n The fourth, pent now, a digit curious.\n Four daughters in a world too intricate\n In the beginning, four blithe instruments\n Of differing struts, four voices several\n In couch, four more personae, intimate\n As buffo, yet divers, four mirrors blue\n That should be silver, four accustomed seeds\n Hinting incredible hues, four self-same lights\n That spread chromatics in hilarious dark,\n Four questioners and four sure answerers.\n\n Crispin concocted doctrine from the rout.\n The world, a turnip once so readily plucked,\n Sacked up and carried overseas, daubed out\n Of its ancient purple, pruned to the fertile main,\n And sown again by the stiffest realist,\n Came reproduced in purple, family font,\n The same insoluble lump. The fatalist\n Stepped in and dropped the chuckling down his craw,\n Without grace or grumble. Score this anecdote\n Invented for its pith, not doctrinal\n In form though in design, as Crispin willed,\n Disguised pronunciamento, summary,\n Autumn's compendium, strident in itself\n But muted, mused, and perfectly revolved\n In those portentous accents, syllables,\n And sounds of music coming to accord\n Upon his law, like their inherent sphere,\n Seraphic proclamations of the pure\n Delivered with a deluging onwardness.\n Or if the music sticks, if the anecdote\n Is false, if Crispin is a profitless\n Philosopher, beginning with green brag,\n Concluding fadedly, if as a man\n Prone to distemper he abates in taste,\n Fickle and fumbling, variable, obscure,\n Glozing his life with after-shining flicks,\n Illuminating, from a fancy gorged\n By apparition, plain and common things,\n Sequestering the fluster from the year,\n Making gulped potions from obstreperous drops,\n And so distorting, proving what he proves\n Is nothing, what can all this matter since\n The relation comes, benignly, to its end?\n\n So may the relation of each man be clipped.",

        "The Idea of Order at Key West": "She sang beyond the genius of the sea.   \n The water never formed to mind or voice,   \n Like a body wholly body, fluttering\n Its empty sleeves; and yet its mimic motion   \n Made constant cry, caused constantly a cry,   \n That was not ours although we understood,   \n Inhuman, of the veritable ocean.\n\n The sea was not a mask. No more was she.   \n The song and water were not medleyed sound   \n Even if what she sang was what she heard,   \n Since what she sang was uttered word by word.\n It may be that in all her phrases stirred   \n The grinding water and the gasping wind;   \n But it was she and not the sea we heard.\n\n For she was the maker of the song she sang.   \n The ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea\n Was merely a place by which she walked to sing.   \n Whose spirit is this? we said, because we knew   \n It was the spirit that we sought and knew   \n That we should ask this often as she sang.\n\n If it was only the dark voice of the sea   \n That rose, or even colored by many waves;   \n If it was only the outer voice of sky\n And cloud, of the sunken coral water-walled,   \n However clear, it would have been deep air,   \n The heaving speech of air, a summer sound   \n Repeated in a summer without end\n And sound alone. But it was more than that,   \n More even than her voice, and ours, among\n The meaningless plungings of water and the wind,   \n Theatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped   \n On high horizons, mountainous atmospheres   \n Of sky and sea.\n\n                            It was her voice that made   \n The sky acutest at its vanishing.   \n She measured to the hour its solitude.   \n She was the single artificer of the world\n In which she sang. And when she sang, the sea,   \n Whatever self it had, became the self\n That was her song, for she was the maker. Then we,   \n As we beheld her striding there alone,\n Knew that there never was a world for her   \n Except the one she sang and, singing, made.\n\n Ramon Fernandez, tell me, if you know,   \n Why, when the singing ended and we turned   \n Toward the town, tell why the glassy lights,   \n The lights in the fishing boats at anchor there,   \n As the night descended, tilting in the air,   \n Mastered the night and portioned out the sea,   \n Fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles,   \n Arranging, deepening, enchanting night.\n\n Oh! Blessed rage for order, pale Ramon,   \n The maker's rage to order words of the sea,   \n Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,   \n And of ourselves and of our origins,\n In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds.",

And does the ear   \n Solace itself in peevish birds? Is it peace,\n Is it a philosopher's honeymoon, one finds\n On the dump? Is it to sit among mattresses of the dead,   \n Bottles, pots, shoes and grass and murmur aptest eve:   \n Is it to hear the blatter of grackles and say\nInvisible priest; is it to eject, to pull\n The day to pieces and cry stanza my stone?\n Where was it one first heard of the truth?

Or do the boughs\n Hang always heavy in that perfect sky,\n Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth,\n With rivers like our own that seek for seas\n They never find, the same receding shores\n That never touch with inarticulate pang?\n Why set the pear upon those river-banks\n Or spice the shores with odors of the plum?\n Alas, that they should wear our colors there,\n The silken weavings of our afternoons,\n And pick the strings of our insipid lutes!\n Death is the mother of beauty, mystical,\n Within whose burning bosom we devise\n Our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly.\n\n\n        VII\n\n Supple and turbulent, a ring of men\n Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn\n Their boisterous devotion to the sun,\n Not as a god, but as a god might be,\n Naked among them, like a savage source.\n Their chant shall be a chant of paradise,\n Out of their blood, returning to the sky;\n And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice,\n The windy lake wherein their lord delights,\n The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills,\n That choir among themselves long afterward.\n They shall know well the heavenly fellowship\n Of men that perish and of summer morn.\n And whence they came and whither they shall go\n The dew upon their feet shall manifest.\n\n\n        VIII\n\n She hears, upon that water without sound,\n A voice that cries, \"The tomb in Palestine\n Is not the porch of spirits lingering.\n It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.\"\n We live in an old chaos of the sun,\n Or old dependency of day and night,\n Or island solitude, unsponsored, free,\n Of that wide water, inescapable.\n Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail\n Whistle about us their spontaneous cries;\n Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness;\n And, in the isolation of the sky,\n At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make\n Ambiguous undulations as they sink,\n Downward to darkness, on extended wings.",
        "Le Monocle de Mon Oncle": "\"Mother of heaven, regina of the clouds,   \n O sceptre of the sun, crown of the moon,   \n There is not nothing, no, no, never nothing,   \n Like the clashed edges of two words that kill.\"\n And so I mocked her in magnificent measure.   \n Or was it that I mocked myself alone?   \n I wish that I might be a thinking stone.   \n The sea of spuming thought foists up again   \n The radiant bubble that she was. And then   \n A deep up-pouring from some saltier well   \n Within me, bursts its watery syllable.\n\n II\n A red bird flies across the golden floor.   \n It is a red bird that seeks out his choir   \n Among the choirs of wind and wet and wing.   \n A torrent will fall from him when he finds.   \n Shall I uncrumple this much-crumpled thing?   \n I am a man of fortune greeting heirs;\n For it has come that thus I greet the spring.   \n These choirs of welcome choir for me farewell.   \n No spring can follow past meridian.\n Yet you persist with anecdotal bliss\n To make believe a starry connaissance.\n\n III\n Is it for nothing, then, that old Chinese   \n Sat tittivating by their mountain pools\n Or in the Yangtse studied out their beards?   \n I shall not play the flat historic scale.   \n You know how Utamaro's beauties sought   \n The end of love in their all-speaking braids.   \n You know the mountainous coiffures of Bath.   \n Alas! Have all the barbers lived in vain   \n That not one curl in nature has survived?   \n Why, without pity on these studious ghosts,   \n Do you come dripping in your hair from sleep?\n\n IV\n This luscious and impeccable fruit of life   \n Falls, it appears, of its own weight to earth.   \n When you were Eve, its acrid juice was sweet,   \n Untasted, in its heavenly, orchard air.   \n An apple serves as well as any skull\n To be the book in which to read a round,   \n And is as excellent, in that it is composed\n Of what, like skulls, comes rotting back to ground.   \n But it excels in this, that as the fruit   \n Of love, it is a book too mad to read   \n Before one merely reads to pass the time.\n\n V\n In the high west there burns a furious star.   \n It is for fiery boys that star was set\n And for sweet-smelling virgins close to them.   \n The measure of the intensity of love\n Is measure, also, of the verve of earth.\n For me, the firefly's quick, electric stroke   \n Ticks tediously the time of one more year.   \n And you? Remember how the crickets came   \n Out of their mother grass, like little kin,   \n In the pale nights, when your first imagery   \n Found inklings of your bond to all that dust.\n\n VI\n If men at forty will be painting lakes\n The ephemeral blues must merge for them in one,   \n The basic slate, the universal hue.   \n There is a substance in us that prevails.   \n But in our amours amorists discern   \n Such fluctuations that their scrivening   \n Is breathless to attend each quirky turn.   \n When amorists grow bald, then amours shrink   \n Into the compass and curriculum   \n Of introspective exiles, lecturing.   \n It is a theme for Hyacinth alone.\n\n VII\n The mules that angels ride come slowly down   \n The blazing passes, from beyond the sun.   \n Descensions of their tinkling bells arrive.   \n These muleteers are dainty of their way.   \n Meantime, centurions guffaw and beat   \n Their shrilling tankards on the table-boards.   \n This parable, in sense, amounts to this:   \n The honey of heaven may or may not come,   \n But that of earth both comes and goes at once.   \n Suppose these couriers brought amid their train   \n A damsel heightened by eternal bloom.\n\n VIII\n Like a dull scholar, I behold, in love,   \n An ancient aspect touching a new mind.\n It comes, it blooms, it bears its fruit and dies.   \n This trivial trope reveals a way of truth.\n Our bloom is gone. We are the fruit thereof.   \n Two golden gourds distended on our vines,   \n Into the autumn weather, splashed with frost,   \n Distorted by hale fatness, turned grotesque.\n We hang like warty squashes, streaked and rayed,   \n The laughing sky will see the two of us   \n Washed into rinds by rotting winter rains.\n\n IX\n In verses wild with motion, full of din,   \n Loudened by cries, by clashes, quick and sure   \n As the deadly thought of men accomplishing   \n Their curious fates in war, come, celebrate   \n The faith of forty, ward of Cupido.\n Most venerable heart, the lustiest conceit   \n Is not too lusty for your broadening.\n I quiz all sounds, all thoughts, all everything   \n For the music and manner of the paladins   \n To make oblation fit. Where shall I find   \n Bravura adequate to this great hymn?\n\n X\n The fops of fancy in their poems leave   \n Memorabilia of the mystic spouts,   \n Spontaneously watering their gritty soils.   \n I am a yeoman, as such fellows go.\n I know no magic trees, no balmy boughs,\n No silver-ruddy, gold-vermilion fruits.   \n But, after all, I know a tree that bears\n A semblance to the thing I have in mind.   \n It stands gigantic, with a certain tip\n To which all birds come sometime in their time.   \n But when they go that tip still tips the tree.\n\n XI\n If sex were all, then every trembling hand   \n Could make us squeak, like dolls, the wished-for words.\n But note the unconscionable treachery of fate,   \n That makes us weep, laugh, grunt and groan, and shout\n Doleful heroics, pinching gestures forth\n From madness or delight, without regard\n To that first, foremost law. Anguishing hour!   \n Last night, we sat beside a pool of pink,\n Clippered with lilies scudding the bright chromes,   \n Keen to the point of starlight, while a frog   \n Boomed from his very belly odious chords.\n\n XII\n A blue pigeon it is, that circles the blue sky,\n On sidelong wing, around and round and round.   \n A white pigeon it is, that flutters to the ground,   \n Grown tired of flight. Like a dark rabbi, I   \n Observed, when young, the nature of mankind,   \n In lordly study. Every day, I found\n Man proved a gobbet in my mincing world.   \n Like a rose rabbi, later, I pursued,\n And still pursue, the origin and course   \n Of love, but until now I never knew\n That fluttering things have so distinct a shade.",
        "A Postcard from the Volcano": "Children picking up our bones\n Will never know that these were once   \n As quick as foxes on the hill;\n\n And that in autumn, when the grapes   \n Made sharp air sharper by their smell   \n These had a being, breathing frost;\n\n And least will guess that with our bones   \n We left much more, left what still is   \n The look of things, left what we felt\n\n At what we saw. The spring clouds blow   \n Above the shuttered mansion-house,   \n Beyond our gate and the windy sky\n\n Cries out a literate despair.\n We knew for long the mansion's look   \n And what we said of it became\n\n A part of what it is ... Children,   \n Still weaving budded aureoles,\n Will speak our speech and never know,\n\n Will say of the mansion that it seems   \n As if he that lived there left behind   \n A spirit storming in blank walls,\n\n A dirty house in a gutted world,\n A tatter of shadows peaked to white,   \n Smeared with the gold of the opulent sun.",
        "Peter Quince at the Clavier": "I Just as my fingers on these keys Make music, so the selfsame sounds On my spirit make a music, too. Music is feeling, then, not sound; And thus it is that what I feel, Here in this room, desiring you,  Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk, Is music. It is like the strain Waked in the elders by Susanna:  Of a green evening, clear and warm, She bathed in her still garden, while The red-eyed elders, watching, felt  The basses of their beings throb In witching chords, and their thin blood Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna.                                                II In the green water, clear and warm, Susanna lay. She searched The touch of springs, And found Concealed imaginings. She sighed, For so much melody.  Upon the bank, she stood In the cool Of spent emotions. She felt, among the leaves, The dew Of old devotions.  She walked upon the grass, Still quavering. The winds were like her maids, On timid feet, Fetching her woven scarves, Yet wavering.  A breath upon her hand Muted the night. She turned-- A cymbal crashed, And roaring horns.                                             III Soon, with a noise like tambourines, Came her attendant Byzantines.  They wondered why Susanna cried Against the elders by her side;  And as they whispered, the refrain Was like a willow swept by rain.  Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame Revealed Susanna and her shame.  And then, the simpering Byzantines Fled, with a noise like tambourines.                                               IV Beauty is momentary in the mind-- The fitful tracing of a portal; But in the flesh it is immortal.  The body dies; the body's beauty lives. So evenings die, in their green going, A wave, interminably flowing. So gardens die, their meek breath scenting The cowl of winter, done repenting. So maidens die, to the auroral Celebration of a maiden's choral.  Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings Of those white elders; but, escaping, Left only Death's ironic scraping. Now, in its immortality, it plays On the clear viol of her memory, And makes a constant sacrament of praise.",
        "A Rabbit as King of the Ghosts": "The difficulty to think at the end of day,   \n When the shapeless shadow covers the sun   \n And nothing is left except light on your fur--\n\n There was the cat slopping its milk all day,   \n Fat cat, red tongue, green mind, white milk   \n And August the most peaceful month.\n\n To be, in the grass, in the peacefullest time,   \n Without that monument of cat,   \n The cat forgotten in the moon;\n\n And to feel that the light is a rabbit-light,   \n In which everything is meant for you   \n And nothing need be explained;\n\n Then there is nothing to think of. It comes of itself;\n And east rushes west and west rushes down,\n No matter. The grass is full\n\n And full of yourself. The trees around are for you,   \n The whole of the wideness of night is for you,   \n A self that touches all edges,\n\n You become a self that fills the four corners of night.\n The red cat hides away in the fur-light\n And there you are humped high, humped up,\n\n You are humped higher and higher, black as stone--\n You sit with your head like a carving in space   \n And the little green cat is a bug in the grass."

        "A Letter": "I came here, being stricken, stumbling out\n At last from streets; the sun, decreasing, took me\n For days, the time being the last of autumn,\n The thickets not yet stark, but quivering\n With tiny colors, like some brush strokes in\n The manner of the pointillists; small yellows\n Dart shaped, little reds in different pattern,\n Clicks and notches of color on threaded bushes,\n A cracked and fluent heaven, and a brown earth.\n I had these, and my food and sleep--enough.\n  \n This is a countryside of roofless houses,--\n Taverns to rain,--doorsteps of millstones, lintels\n Leaning and delicate, foundations sprung to lilacs.\n Orchards where boughs like roots strike into the sky.\n Here I could well devise the journey to nothing,\n At night getting down from the wagon by the black barns,\n The zenith a point of darkness, breaking to bits,\n Showering motionless stars over the houses.\n Scenes relentless--the black and white grooves of a woodcut.\n  \n But why the journey to nothing or any desire?\n Why the heart taken by even senseless adventure,\n The goal a coffer of dust?    Give my mouth to the air,\n Let arrogant pain lick my flesh with a tongue\n Rough as a cat's; remember the smell of cold mornings,\n The dried beauty of women, the exquisite skin\n Under the chins of young girls, young men's rough beards,--\n The cringing promise of this one, that one's apology\n For the knife struck down to the bone, gladioli in sick rooms,\n Asters and dahlias, flowers like ruches, rosettes. . .\n  \n Forever enough to part grass over the stones\n By some brook or well, the lovely seed-shedding stalks;\n To hear in the single wind diverse branches\n Repeating their sounds to the sky--that sky like scaled mackerel,\n Fleeing the fields--to be defended from silence,\n To feel my body as arid, as safe as a twig\n Broken away from whatever growth could snare it\n Up to a spring, or hold it softly in summer\n Or beat it under in snow.\n  \n                                                        I must get well.\n Walk on strong legs, leap the hurdles of sense,  \n Reason again, come back to my old patchwork logic,\n Addition, subtraction, money, clothes, clocks,\n Memories (freesias, smelling slightly of snow and of flesh\n In a room with blue curtains) ambition, despair.\n I must feel again who had given feeling over,\n Challenge laughter, take tears, play the piano,\n Form judgments, blame a crude world for disaster.\n  \n To escape is nothing.    Not to escape is nothing.\n The farmer's wife stands with a halo of darkness\n Rounding her head.    Water drips in the kitchen\n Tapping the sink.    To-day the maples have split\n Limb from the trunk with the ice, a fresh wooden wound.\n The vines are distorted with ice, ice burdens the breaking\n Roofs I have told you of.",
        "Betrothed": "You have put your two hands upon me, and your mouth,\n You have said my name as a prayer.\n Here where trees are planted by the water\n I have watched your eyes, cleansed from regret,\n And your lips, closed over all that love cannot say,\n  \n          My mother remembers the agony of her womb\n          And long years that seemed to promise more than this.\n          She says, \"You do not love me,\n          You do not want me,\n          You will go away.\"\n  \n          In the country whereto I go\n          I shall not see the face of my friend\n          Nor her hair the color of sunburnt grasses;\n          Together we shall not find\n          The land on whose hills bends the new moon\n          In air traversed of birds.\n          \n What have I thought of love?\n I have said, \"It is beauty and sorrow.\"\n I have thought that it would bring me lost delights, and splendor\n As a wind out of old time. . .\n  \n But there is only the evening here,\n And the sound of willows\n Now and again dipping their long oval leaves in the water.",

        "My Voice Not Being Proud": "My voice, not being proud\n Like a strong woman's, that cries\n Imperiously aloud\n That death disarm her, lull her--\n Screams for no mourning color\n Laid menacingly, like fire,\n Over my long desire.\n It will end, and leave no print.\n As you lie, I shall lie:\n Separate, eased, and cured.\n Whatever is wasted or wanted\n In this country of glass and flint\n Some garden will use, once planted.\n As you lie alone, I shall lie,\n O, in singleness assured,\n Deafened by mire and lime.\n I remember, while there is time.",
        "Fifteenth Farewell": "I\n You may have all things from me, save my breath,\n The slight life in my throat will not give pause\n For your love, nor your loss, nor any cause.\n Shall I be made a panderer to death,\n Dig the green ground for darkness underneath,\n Let the dust serve me, covering all that was\n With all that will be? Better, from time's claws,\n The hardened face under the subtle wreath.\n  \n Cooler than stones in wells, sweeter, more kind\n Than hot, perfidious words, my breathing moves\n Close to my plunging blood.    Be strong, and hang\n Unriven mist over my breast and mind,\n My breath! We shall forget the heart that loves,\n Though in my body beat its blade, and its fang.\n  \n                                     II\n I erred, when I thought loneliness the wide\n Scent of mown grass over forsaken fields,\n Or any shadow isolation yields.\n Loneliness was the heart within your side.\n Your thought, beyond my touch, was tilted air\n Ringed with as many borders as the wind.\n How could I judge you gentle or unkind\n When all bright flying space was in your care?\n  \n Now that I leave you, I shall be made lonely\n By simple empty days, never that chill\n Resonant heart to strike between my arms\n Again, as though distraught for distance,-only\n Levels of evening, now, behind a hill,\n Or a late cock-crow from the darkening farms.",
        "Sonnet": "Since you would claim the sources of my thought\nRecall the meshes whence it sprang unlimed,\nThe reedy traps which other hands have timed\nTo close upon it. Conjure up the hot\nBlaze that it cleared so cleanly, or the snow\nDevised to strike it down. It will be free.\nWhatever nets draw in to prison me\nAt length your eyes must turn to watch it go.\n  \nMy mouth, perhaps, may learn one thing too well,\nMy body hear no echo save its own,\nYet will the desperate mind, maddened and proud,\nSeek out the storm, escape the bitter spell\nThat we obey, strain to the wind, be thrown\nStraight to its freedom in the thunderous cloud.",
        "Epitaph for a Romantic Woman": "She has attained the permanence\n She dreamed of, where old stones lie sunning.\n Untended stalks blow over her\n Even and swift, like young men running.\n\n Always in the heart she loved\n Others had lived,--she heard their laughter.\n She lies where none has lain before,\n Where certainly none will follow after.",
        "Medusa": "I had come to the house, in a cave of trees,\n Facing a sheer sky.\n Everything moved,--a bell hung ready to strike,\n Sun and reflection wheeled by.\n\n When the bare eyes were before me\n And the hissing hair,\n Held up at a window, seen through a door.\n The stiff bald eyes, the serpents on the forehead\n Formed in the air.\n\n This is a dead scene forever now.\n Nothing will ever stir.\n The end will never brighten it more than this,\n Nor the rain blur.\n\n The water will always fall, and will not fall,\n And the tipped bell make no sound.\n The grass will always be growing for hay\n Deep on the ground.\n\n And I shall stand here like a shadow\n Under the great balanced day,\n My eyes on the yellow dust, that was lifting in the wind,\n And does not drift away.",
        "Women": "Women have no wilderness in them,\n They are provident instead,\n Content in the tight hot cell of their hearts\n To eat dusty bread.\n\n They do not see cattle cropping red winter grass,\n They do not hear\n Snow water going down under culverts\n Shallow and clear.\n\n They wait, when they should turn to journeys,\n They stiffen, when they should bend.\n They use against themselves that benevolence\n To which no man is friend.\n\n They cannot think of so many crops to a field\n Or of clean wood cleft by an axe.\n Their love is an eager meaninglessness\n Too tense, or too lax.\n\n They hear in every whisper that speaks to them\n A shout and a cry.\n As like as not, when they take life over their door-sills\n They should let it go by.",
        "Leave-Taking": "I do not know where either of us can turn Just at first, waking from the sleep of each other. I do not know how we can bear The river struck by the gold plummet of the moon, Or many trees shaken together in the darkness. We shall wish not to be alone And that love were not dispersed and set free-- Though you defeat me, And I be heavy upon you.  But like earth heaped over the heart Is love grown perfect. Like a shell over the beat of life Is love perfect to the last. So let it be the same Whether we turn to the dark or to the kiss of another; Let us know this for leavetaking, That I may not be heavy upon you, That you may blind me no more.",
        "To a Dead Lover": "The dark is thrown Back from the brightness, like hair Cast over a shoulder. I am alone,  Four years older; Like the chairs and the walls Which I once watched brighten With you beside me. I was to waken Never like this, whatever came or was taken.  The stalk grows, the year beats on the wind. Apples come, and the month for their fall. The bark spreads, the roots tighten. Though today be the last Or tomorrow all, You will not mind.  That I may not remember Does not matter. I shall not be with you again. What we knew, even now Must scatter And be ruined, and blow Like dust in the rain.  You have been dead a long season And have less than desire Who were lover with lover; And I have life--that old reason To wait for what comes, To leave what is over.",
        "Portrait": "She has no need to fear the fall Of harvest from the laddered reach Of orchards, nor the tide gone ebbing       From the steep beach.  Nor hold to pain's effrontery Her body's bulwark, stern and savage, Nor be a glass, where to forsee       Another's ravage.  What she has gathered, and what lost, She will not find to lose again. She is possessed by time, who once       Was loved by men.",
        "A Tale": "Highlight Actions\nDisable annotations\n\n\n\n\nThis youth too long has heard the break\n Of waters in a land of change.\n He goes to see what suns can make\n From soil more indurateindurate hardened and strange.\n\n He cuts what holds his days together\n And shuts him in, as lock on lock:\n The arrowed vane announcing weather,\n The tripping rackettripping racket either a paradox: light and easy din, or, light and easy motion (as of a dance)  of a clock;\n\n Seeking, I think, a light that waits\n Still as a lamp upon a shelf, --\n A land with hills like rocky gates\n Where no sea leaps upon itself.\n\n But he will find that nothing dares\n To be enduring, save where, south\n Of hidden deserts, torn fire glares\n On beauty with a rusted mouth, --\n\n Where something dreadful and another\n Look quietly upon each other."

I hear again,\n Within, the scutter where the mice carouse,\n      Without, the gutter dropping with the rain.\n Opposite, are black shelves of wormy books,\n      To left, glazed cases, dusty with the same,\n Behind, a wall, with rusty guns on hooks,\n      To right, the fire, that chokes one panting flame.\n Over the mantel, black as funeral cloth,\n      A portrait hangs, a man, whose flesh the worm\n Has mawed this hundred years, whose clothes the moth\n      A century since, has channelled to a term.\n I cannot see his face :  I only know\n He stares at me, that man of long ago.\n  \n I light the candles in the long brass sticks,\n      I see him now, a pale-eyed, simpering man,\n Framed in carved wood, wherein the death-watch ticks,\n      A most dead face :  yet when the work began\n That face, the pale puce coat, the simpering smile,\n      The hands that hold a book, the eyes that gaze,\n Moved to the touch of mind a little while.\n      The painter sat in judgment on his ways :\n The painter turned him to and from the light,\n      Talked about art, or bade him lift his head.\n Judged the lips' paleness and the temples' white,\n      And now his work abides ;  the man is dead.\n But is he dead ?  This dusty study drear\n Creaks in its panels that the man is here.\n  \n Here, beyond doubt, he lived, in that old day.\n      \"He was a Doctor here,\" the student thought.\n Here, when the puce was new, that now is grey,\n      That simpering man his daily practice wrought.\n Here he let blood, prescribed the pill and drop,\n      The leech, the diet ;  here his verdict given\n Brought agonies of hoping to a stop,\n      Here his condemned confessioners were shriven.\n What is that book he holds, the key, too dim\n      To read, to know ;  some little book he wrote,\n Forgotten now, but still the key to him.\n      He sacrificed his vision for his coat.\n I see the man ;  a simpering mask that hid\n A seeing mind that simpering men forbid.\n  \n Those are his books no doubt, untoucht, undusted,\n      Unread, since last he left them on the shelves,\n Octavo sermons that the fox has rusted,\n      Sides splitting off from brown decaying twelves.\n This was his room, this darkness of old death,\n      This coffin-room with lights like embrasures,\n The place is poisonous with him ;  like a breath\n      On glass, he stains the spirit ;  he endures.\n Here is his name within the sermon book,\n      And verse, \"When hungry Worms my Body eat\" ;\n He leans across my shoulder as I look,\n      He who is God or pasture to the wheat.\n He who is Dead is still upon the soul\n      A check, an inhibition, a control.\n  \n I draw the bolts.     I am alone within.\n      The moonlight through the coloured glass comes faint,\n Mottling the passage wall like human skin,\n      Pale with the breathings left of withered paint.\n But others walk the empty house with me,\n      There is no loneliness within these walls\n No more than there is stillness in the sea\n      Or silence in the eternal waterfalls.\n There in the room, to right, they sit at feast ;\n      The dropping grey-beard with the cold blue eye,\n The lad, his son, that should have been a priest,\n      And he, the rake, who made his mother die.\n And he, the gambling man, who staked the throw,\n They look me through, they follow when I go.\n  \n They follow with still footing down the hall,\n      I know their souls, those fellow-tenants mine,\n Their shadows dim those colours on the wall,\n      They point my every gesture with a sign.\n That grey-beard cast his aged servant forth\n      After his forty years of service done,\n The gambler supped up riches as the north\n      Sups with his death the glories of the sun.\n The lad betrayed his trust ;  the rake was he\n      Who broke two women's hearts to ease his own :\n They nudge each other as they look at me,\n      Shadows, all our, and yet as hard as stone.\n And there, he comes, that simpering man, who sold\n His mind for coat of puce and penny gold.\n  \n O ruinous house, within whose corridors\n      None but the wicked and the mad go free.\n (On the dark stairs they wait, behind the doors\n      They crouch, they watch, or creep to follow me.)\n Deep in old blood your ominous bricks are red,\n      Firm in old bones your walls' foundations stand,\n With dead men's passions built upon the dead,\n      With broken hearts for lime and oaths for sand.\n Terrible house, whose horror I have built,\n      Sin after sin, unseen, as sand that slips\n Telling the time, till now the heaped guilt\n      Cries, and the planets circle to eclipse.\n You only are the Daunter, you alone\n Clutch, till I feel your ivy on the bone.",

Because you have to suffer.\n  \n We pride ourselves on a high quality of suffering.\n  \n Turgenev was born in 1818 in the Province of Orel, and suffered\n during his childhood from a tyrannical mother.\n  \n In the past their suffering was less absurd.\n  \n The problem is, everything's worse. Like, paper or plastic? We're all\n still going to die suffering.\n  \n I value being alone with my thoughts, but it's weird to say, \"This\n thing that makes us suffer less, we have to stop doing it.\"\n  \n Isn't it kind of the point of culture to assuage our feeling needless\n and alone?\n  \n How does one suffer \"gladly,\" exactly?\n  \n At least the rich get to suffer in comfort.\n  \n It makes the life feel longer. Live to suffer another day.\n  \n One's past suffering can be a great source of comfort. A torturous\n luxury.

Nurse,\n we won't forget the animated\n video of our cholesterol highway\n where LDL, black-hatted scowling\n donut holes on wheels, blocked traffic.\n\n But with muscles like gutta-percha,\n can we leave time's gurney in the dust?\n By now only the dead know more about\n gravity than we do. In reply, a tape\n of Little Richard or Jerry Lee comes on\n and we're singing, aloud or not, all\n pale infarcted pedalers, rowers, treadmillers,\n and our hearts are rising in the east."

He had no family, and because he worried so much about them: What if, what if, what if, like another beast pawing away, he'd invented a vitamin for everyone old that allowed you to continue slowly to grow until you forgot everything you once knew.",
        "Landscape with Horse Named Popcorn": "The hummingbird hovers over bougainvillea, darting in and out   of blossoms as the bride throws    her corset among laughter and waving hands. Seeing you, glass in hand, sunlight   piercing the punch bowl's crystal, I remember    the horse, an Appaloosa, the white and gray markings   like clouds, cumulus, one    later on his grave, the 2X4 cross with name   above a swell of land that could bring   a man to his knees,    or make him look up at fumbling shapes, cotton-fumed   and slow. I can hear the screeching    still. The colt had grabbed a turkey nesting in scrub oak, and prancing,   shook it in his mouth as we ran    reaching toward black feathers--then the fine   spray of blood--until beyond adrenaline we began laughing,  as laughing now, brushing confetti away, you hand   the bride flowers, narcissi, their green throats pushing up   from wet stones in a jar."

My mother's van was orange\n with a door we slid open to reveal\n beheaded plastic dragons and bunches\n  \n of black, half-eaten bananas; it was where\n her sketchbooks tarried among\n abandoned coffee cups and\n  \n science projects. She meant to go places\n in it: camp in its back seat\n and cook on its stove while\n  \n painting the coast of Nova Scotia,\n or capturing the cold beauty of the Blue Ridge\n mountains at dawn. Instead, she waited\n behind its wheel while we scraped violins,\n  \n made digestive sounds\n with trumpets, danced badly at recitals\n where grandmothers recorded us\n  \n with unsteady cameras. Sometimes, now,\n I look out a window and believe I see it,\n see her, waiting for me beside a curb,\n  \n under a tree, and I think I could open the door,\n clear off a seat, look at the drawing in her lap,\n which she began, but never seemed to finish.",

She got Stravinsky's\n Rite of Spring stuck in the tape deck of her car and for months\n each errand was accompanied by some kind\n of dramatic movement. After my brother was born,\n there was a period during which she wore a muumuu\n and devoted herself to King Sunny Ade and his\n African beats. She ironed and wept to Evita, painted\n to Italian opera. Then, older and heavier, she refused\n to fasten her seatbelt and there was the music\n of an automated bell going off every few minutes,\n which annoyed the rest of us but did not seem to matter\n to my mother who ignored its relentless disapproval,\n its insistence that someone was unsafe.",

I knew him\n as a citizen of the night:\n  \n a fainting, ghostly presence\n with a tail so naked it was\n embarrassed to drag behind him.\n  \n But that morning, terrified and violent,\n he was different: a hissing fury\n at the bottom of the garbage can,\n a vampire bathed in light.",

You were\n revealed to me: tiny, delicate,\n your head smelling of some other world.\n Turn right after the circular room\n\n where I kept my books and right again\n past the crib where you did not sleep\n and you will find the window where\n I held you that June morning\n when you opened your eyes. They were\n\n blue, tentative, not the deep chocolate\n they would later become. You were gazing\n into the world: at our walls,\n my red cup, my sleepless hair and though\n I'm told you could not focus, and you\n\n no longer remember, we were seeing\n one another after seasons of darkness."

Grandma says not to eat the part\n next to the wound, \"Cut it out; offer it to the earth for\n healing, a sacrifice to remember the hungering spirits.\"\n  \n Auntie says to save the muscle along the back strap,\n \"It makes good thread.\" I carefully learned the exact\n place to cut the joints so the bones separate easily.\n  \n Mother said that is important--\"It means you are a\n thoughtful person.\" Auntie is at the door waiting for\n a roast. \"An elder takes the first piece,\" she reminded.\n  \n Mom tells me to save the hooves for her. She wants\n to make a bone game for the new grandchild, wants\n him to be patient and skillful. I boil the hoofs with\n  \n sage, find the little toe-bones for her. My hands begin\n to ache from the work, I soak them in warm water\n and start again. I admire the placement of tendons\n  \n on the deer shoulders, no joints, just the crisscrossing\n of muscle. Grandma says, \"That's why your dad called\n them jumpers, they bounce off the strength of their\n  \n flexing muscles.\" Late at night Mom helps me stake\n out the hide. My back hurts; my feet feel like I've\n been walking on rocks all day. I want to complain,\n  \n but Mom catches the look in my eyes. She says to me,\n \"When you get dressed for the dance this weekend,\n you will proudly wear your beautiful beaded dress,\n  \n your beaded leggings and moccasins, and last, but not\n least, you will put on your beaded belt, and attached\n you will wear your sharp knife and quilled knife sheath\n  \n because of what you have done this day.\""

How easy\n it is, to shatter chinoiserie, like the Han\n  \n dynasty urn Ai Weiwei dropped in 1995.\n If only recovering the silenced history\n  \n is as simple as smashing its container: book,\n bowl, celadon spoon. Such objects cross\n  \n borders the way our bodies never could.\n Instead, we're left with history, its blonde\n  \n dust. That bowl is unbreakable. All its ghosts\n still shudder through us like small breaths.\n  \n The tome of hegemony lives on, circulates\n in our libraries, in our bloodstreams.

        "Resurrection": "In the autumn I moved to New York,\n I recognized her face all over the subway\n stations--pearls around her throat, she poses\n for her immigration papers. In 1924, the only\n Americans required to carry identity cards\n were ethnically Chinese--the first photo IDs,\n red targets on the head of every man, woman,\n child, infant, movie star. Like pallbearers,\n they lined up to get their pictures taken: full-face\n view, direct camera gaze, no smiles, ears showing,\n in silver gelatin. A rogue's gallery of Chinese\n exclusion. The subway poster doesn't name\n her--though it does mention her ethnicity,\n and the name of the New-York Historical\n Society exhibition: Exclusion/Inclusion.\n Soon, when I felt alone in this city, her face\n would peer at me from behind seats, turnstiles,\n heads, and headphones, and I swear she wore\n a smile only I could see. Sometimes my face\n aligned with hers, and we would rush past\n the bewildered lives before us--hers, gone\n the year my mother was born, and mine,\n a belt of ghosts trailing after my scent.\n In the same aboveground train, in the same\n city where slain umbrellas travel across\n the Hudson River, we live and live.\n I've left my landline so ghosts can't dial me\n at midnight with the hunger of hunters\n anymore. I'm so hungry I gnaw at light.\n It tunnels from the shadows, an exhausting\n hope. I know this hunger tormented her too.\n It haunted her through her years in L.A., Paris,\n and New York, the parties she went to, people\n she met--Paul Robeson, Zora Neale Hurston,\n Langston Hughes, Gertrude Stein. It haunts\n her expression still, on the 6 train, Grand\n Central station, an echo chamber behind\n her eyes.

        "Dreams": "Despite the geologists' knowledge and craft, mocking magnets, graphs, and maps-- in a split second the dream piles before us mountains as stony as real life. And since mountains, then valleys, plains with perfect infrastructures. Without engineers, contractors, workers, bulldozers, diggers, or supplies-- raging highways, instant bridges, thickly populated pop-up cities. Without directors, megaphones, and cameramen-- crowds knowing exactly when to frighten us and when to vanish. Without architects deft in their craft, without carpenters, bricklayers, concrete pourers--on the path a sudden house just like a toy, and in it vast halls that echo with our steps and walls constructed out of solid air. Not just the scale, it's also the precision--a specific watch, an entire fly, on the table a cloth with cross-stitched flowers, a bitten apple with teeth marks. And we--unlike circus acrobats, conjurers, wizards, and hypnotists-- can fly unfledged, we light dark tunnels with our eyes, we wax eloquent in unknown tongues, talking not with just anyone, but with the dead. And as a bonus, despite our own freedom, the choices of our heart, our tastes, we're swept away by amorous yearnings for--and the alarm clock rings. So what can they tell us, the writers of dream books,the scholars of oneiric signs and omens, the doctors with couches for analyses-- if anything fits, it's accidental, and for one reason only, that in our dreamings, in their shadowings and gleamings, in their multiplings, inconceivablings, in their haphazardings and widescatterings at times even a clear-cut meaning may slip through."

        "Erinna": "Was she of spirit race, or was she one\nOf earth's least earthly daughters, one to whom\nA gift of loveliness and soul is given,\nOnly to make them wretched?\n\nThere is an antique gem, on which her brow\nRetains its graven beauty even now.\nHer hair is braided, but one curl behind\nFloats as enamour'd of the summer wind;\nThe rest is simple. Is she not too fair\nEven to think of maiden's sweetest care?\nThe mouth and brow are contrasts. One so fraught\nWith pride, the melancholy pride of thought\nConscious of power, and yet forced to know\nHow little way such power as that can go;\nRegretting, while too proud of the fine mind,\nWhich raises but to part it from its kind:\nBut the sweet mouth had nothing of all this;\nIt was a mouth the rose had lean'd to kiss\nFor her young sister, telling, now though mute,\nHow soft an echo it was to the lute.\nThe one spoke genius, in its high revealing;\nThe other smiled a woman's gentle feeling.\nIt was a lovely face: the Greek outline\nFlowing, yet delicate and feminine;\nThe glorious lightning of the kindled eye,\nRaised, as it communed with its native sky.\nA lovely face the spirit's fitting shrine;\nThe one almost, the other quite divine.\n\n\n\n\nMy hand is on the lyre which never more\n With its sweet commerce, like a bosom friend,\n Will share the deeper thoughts which I could trust\n Only to music and to solitude.\n It is the very grove, the olive grove,\n Where first I laid my laurel crown aside,\n And bathed my fever'd brow in the cold stream;\n As if that I could wash away the fire\n Which from that moment kindled in my heart.\n I well remember how I flung myself,\n Like a young goddess, on a purple cloud\n Of light and odour -- the rich violets\n Were so ethereal in bloom and breath:\n And I -- I felt immortal, for my brain\n Was drunk and mad with its first draught of fame.\n 'Tis strange there was one only cypress tree,\n And then, as now, I lay beneath its shade.\n The night had seen me pace my lonely room,\n Clasping the lyre I had no heart to wake,\n Impatient for the day: yet its first dawn\n Came cold as death; for every pulse sank down,\n Until the very presence of my hope\n Became to me a fear.    The sun rose up;\n I stood alone 'mid thousands: but I felt\n Mine inspiration; and, as the last sweep\n Of my song died away amid the hills,\n My heart reverb'rated the shout which bore\n To the blue mountains and the distant heaven\nErinna's name, and on my bended knee,\n Olympus, I received thy laurel crown.\n  \n    And twice new birth of violets have sprung,\n Since they were first my pillow, since I sought\n In the deep silence of the olive grove\n The dreamy happiness which solitude\n Brings to the soul o'erfill'd with its delight:\n For I was like some young and sudden heir\n Of a rich palace heap'd with gems and gold,\n Whose pleasure doubles as he sums his wealth\n And forms a thousand plans of festival;\n Such were my myriad visions of delight.\n The lute, which hitherto in Delphian shades\n Had been my twilight's solitary joy,\n Would henceforth be a sweet and breathing bond\n Between me and my kind.    Orphan unloved,\n I had been lonely from my childhood's hour,\n Childhood whose very happiness is love:\n But that was over now; my lyre would be\n My own heart's true interpreter, and those\n To whom my song was dear, would they not bless\n The hand that waken'd it? I should be loved\n For the so gentle sake of those soft chords\n Which mingled others' feelings with mine own.\n  \n     Vow'd I that song to meek and gentle thoughts,\n To tales that told of sorrow and of love,\n To all our nature's finest touches, all\n That wakens sympathy: and I should be\n Alone no longer; every wind that bore,\n And every lip that breathed one strain of mine,\n Henceforth partake in all my joy and grief.\n Oh! glorious is the gifted poet's lot,\n And touching more than glorious: 'tis to be\n Companion of the heart's least earthly hour;\n The voice of love and sadness, calling forth\n Tears from their silent fountain: 'tis to have\n Share in all nature's loveliness; giving flowers\n A life as sweet, more lasting than their own;\n And catching from green wood and lofty pine\n Language mysterious as musical;\n Making the thoughts, which else had only been\n Like colours on the morning's earliest hour,\n Immortal, and worth immortality;\n Yielding the hero that eternal name\n For which he fought; making the patriot's deed\n A stirring record for long after-time;\n Cherishing tender thoughts, which else had pass'd\n Away like tears; and saving the loved dead\n From death's worst part -- its deep forgetfulness.\n  \n From the first moment when a falling leaf,\n Or opening bud, or streak of rose-touch'd sky,\n Waken'd in me the flush and flow of song,\n I gave my soul entire unto the gift\n I deem'd mine own, direct from heaven; it was\n The hope, the bliss, the energy of life;\n I had no hope that dwelt not with my lyre,\n No bliss whose being grew not from my lyre,\n No energy undevoted to my lyre.\n It was my other self that had a power;\n Mine, but o'er which I had not a control.\n At times it was not with me, and I felt\n A wonder how it ever had been mine:\n And then a word, a look of loveliness,\n A tone of music, call'd it into life;\n A song came gushing, like the natural tears,\n To check whose current does not rest with us.\n  \n     Had I lived ever in the savage woods,\n Or in some distant island, which the sea\n With wind and wave guards in deep loneliness;\n Had my eye never on the beauty dwelt\n Of human face, and my ear never drank\n The music of a human voice; I feel\n My spirit would have pour'd itself in song,\n Have learn'd a language from the rustling leaves,\n The singing of the birds, and of the tide.\n Perchance, then, happy had I never known\n Another thought could be attach'd to song\n Than of its own delight.    Oh! let me pause\n Over this earlier period, when my heart\n Mingled its being with its pleasures, fill'd\n With rich enthusiasm, which once flung\n Its purple colouring o'er all things of earth,\n And without which our utmost power of thought\n But sharpens arrows that will drink our blood.\n Like woman's soothing influence o'er man\n Enthusiasm is upon the mind;\n Softening and beautifying that which is\n Too harsh and sullen in itself.    How much\n I loved the painter's glorious art, which forms\n A world like, but more beautiful than, this;\n Just catching nature in her happiest mood!\n How drank I in fine poetry, which makes\n The hearing passionate, fill'd with memories\n Which steal from out the past like rays from clouds!\n And then the sweet songs of my native vale,\n Whose sweetness and whose softness call'd to mind\n The perfume of the flowers, the purity\n Of the blue sky; oh, how they stirr'd my soul! --\n Amid the many golden gifts which heaven\n Has left, like portions of its light, on earth\n None hath such influence as music hath.\n The painter's hues stand visible before us\n In power and beauty; we can trace the thoughts\n Which are the workings of the poet's mind:\n But music is a mystery, and viewless\n Even when present, and is less man's act,\n And less within his order; for the hand\n That can call forth the tones, yet cannot tell\n Whither they go, or if they live or die,\n When floated once beyond his feeble ear;\n And then, as if it were an unreal thing,\n The wind will sweep from the neglected strings\n As rich a swell as ever minstrel drew.\n  \n     A poet's word, a painter's touch, will reach\n The innermost recesses of the heart,\n Making the pulses throb in unison\n With joy or grief, which we can analyse;\n There is the cause for pleasure and for pain:\n But music moves us, and we know not why;\n We feel the tears, but cannot trace their source.\n Is it the language of some other state,\n Born of its memory?    For what can wake\n The soul's strong instinct of another world,\n Like music?    Well with sadness doth it suit\n To hear the melancholy sounds decay,\n And think (for thoughts are life's great human links,\n And mingle with our feelings) even so\n Will the heart's wildest pulses sink to rest.\n  \n     How have I loved, when the red evening fill'd\n Our temple with its glory, first, to gaze\n On the strange contrast of the crimson air,\n Lighted as if with passion, and flung back,\n From silver vase and tripod rich with gems,\n To the pale statues round, where human life\n Was not, but beauty was, which seem'd to have\n Apart existence from humanity:\n Then, to go forth where the tall waving pines\n Seem'd as behind them roll'd a golden sea\n Immortal and eternal; and the boughs,\n That darkly swept between me and its light,\n Were fitting emblems of the worldly cares\n That are the boundary between us and heaven;\n Meanwhile, the wind, a wilful messenger\n Lingering amid the flowers on his way,\n At intervals swept past in melody,\n The lutes and voices of the choral hymn\n Contending with the rose-breath on his wing!\n Perhaps it is these pleasures' chiefest charm,\n They are so indefinable, so vague.\n From earliest childhood all too well aware\n Of the uncertain nature of our joys,\n It is delicious to enjoy, yet know\n No after-consequence will be to weep.\n Pride misers with enjoyment, when we have\n Delight in things that are but of the mind:\n But half humility when we partake\n Pleasures that are half wants, the spirit pines\n And struggles in its fetters, and disdains\n The low base clay to which it is allied.\n But here our rapture raises us: we feel\n What glorious power is given to man, and find\n Our nature's nobleness and attributes,\n Whose heaven is intellect; and we are proud\n To think how we can love those things of earth\n Which are least earthly; and the soul grows pure\n In this high communing, and more divine.\n  \n     This time of dreaming happiness pass'd by,\n Another spirit was within my heart;\n I drank the maddening cup of praise, which grew\n Henceforth the fountain of my life; I lived\n Only in others' breath; a word, a look,\n Were of all influence on my destiny:\n If praise they spoke, 'twas sunlight to my soul;\n Or censure, it was like the scorpion's sting.\n  \n And yet a darker lesson was to learn --\n The hollowness of each: that praise, which is\n But base exchange of flattery; that blame,\n Given by cautious coldness, which still deems\n 'Tis safest to depress; that mockery,\n Flinging shafts but to show its own keen aim;\n That carelessness, whose very censure's chance;\n And, worst of all, the earthly judgment pass'd\n By minds whose native clay is unredeem'd\n By aught of heaven, whose every thought falls foul\n Plague-spot on beauty which they cannot feel,\n Tainting all that it touches with itself.\n O dream of fame, what hast thou been to me\n But the destroyer of life's calm content!\n I feel so more than ever, that thy sway\n Is weaken'd over me. Once I could find\n A deep and dangerous delight in thee;\n But that is gone.    I am too much awake.\n Light has burst o'er me, but not morning's light;\n 'Tis such light as will burst upon the tomb,\n When all but judgment's over.    Can it be,\n That these fine impulses, these lofty thoughts,\n Burning with their own beauty, are but given\n To make me the low slave of vanity,\n Heartless and humbled?     O my own sweet power,\n Surely thy songs are made for more than this!\n What a worst waste of feeling and of life\n Have been the imprints of my roll of time,\n Too much, too long!    To what use have I turn'd\n The golden gifts in which I pride myself?\n They are profaned; with their pure ore I made\n A temple resting only on the breath\n Of heedless worshippers.    Alas! that ever\n Praise should have been what it has been to me --\n The opiate of my heart.    Yet I have dream'd\n Of things which cannot be; the bright, the pure,\n That all of which the heart may only dream;\n And I have mused upon my gift of song,\n And deeply felt its beauty, and disdain'd\n The pettiness of praise to which at times\n My soul has bow'd; and I have scorn'd myself\n For that my cheek could burn, my pulses beat\n At idle words.    And yet it is in vain\n For the full heart to press back every throb\n Wholly upon itself.    Ay, fair as are\n The visions of a poet's solitude,\n There must be something more for happiness;\n They seek communion.    It had seem'd to me\n A miser's selfishness, had I not sought\n To share with others those impassion'd thoughts,\n Like light, or hope, or love, in their effects.\n When I have watch'd the stars write on the sky\n In characters of light, have seen the moon\n Come like veiled priestess from the east,\n While, like a hymn, the wind swell'd on mine ear,\n Telling soft tidings of eve's thousand flowers,\n Has it not been the transport of my lute\n To find its best delight in sympathy?\n Alas! the idols which our hopes set up,\n They are Chaldean ones, half gold, half clay;\n We trust we are deceived, we hope, we fear,\n Alike without foundation; day by day\n Some new illusion is destroyed, and life\n Gets cold and colder on towards its close.\n Just like the years which make it, some are check'd\n By sudden blights in spring; some are dried up\n By fiery summers; others waste away\n In calm monotony of quiet skies,\n And peradventure these may be the best:\n They know no hurricanes, no floods that sweep\n As a God's vengeance were upon each wave;\n But then they have no ruby fruits, no flowers\n Shining in purple, and no lighted mines\n Of gold and diamond.    Which is the best, --\n Beauty and glory, in a southern clime,\n Mingled with thunder, tempest; or the calm\n Of skies that scarcely change, which, at the least,\n If much of shine they have not, have no storms?\n I know not: but I know fair earth or sky\n Are self-consuming in their loveliness,\n And the too radiant sun and fertile soil\n In their luxuriance run themselves to waste,\n And the green valley and the silver stream\n Become a sandy desert.    O! the mind,\n Too vivid in its lighted energies,\n May read its fate in sunny Araby.\n How lives its beauty in each Eastern tale,\n Its growth of spices, and its groves of balm!\n They are exhausted; and what is it now?\n A wild and burning wilderness.    Alas!\n For such similitude. Too much this is\n The fate of this world's loveliest and best.\n  \n     Is there not a far people, who possess\n Mysterious oracles of olden time,\n Who say that this earth labours with a curse,\n That it is fallen from its first estate,\n And is now but the shade of what it was?\n I do believe the tale.    I feel its truth\n In my vain aspirations, in the dreams\n That are revealings of another world,\n More pure, more perfect than our weary one,\n Where day is darkness to the starry soul.\n  \n     O heart of mine! my once sweet paradise\n Of love and hope! how changed thou art to me!\n I cannot count thy changes: thou hast lost\n Interest in the once idols of thy being;\n They have departed, even as if wings\n Had borne away their morning; they have left\n Weariness, turning pleasure into pain,\n And too sure knowledge of their hollowness.\n  \n     And that too is gone from me; that which was\n My solitude's delight!    I can no more\n Make real existence of a shadowy world.\n Time was, the poet's song, the ancient tale,\n Were to me fountains of deep happiness,\n For they grew visible in my lonely hours,\n As things in which I had a deed and part;\n Their actual presence had not been more true:\n But these are bubbling sparkles, that are found\n But at the spring's first source.    Ah! years may bring\n The mind to its perfection, but no more\n Will those young visions live in their own light;\n Life's troubles stir life's waters all too much,\n Passions chase fancies, and though still we dream,\n The colouring is from reality.\n  \n     Farewell, my lyre! thou hast not been to me\n All I once hoped.    What is the gift of mind,\n But as a barrier to so much that makes\n Our life endurable, -- companionship,\n Mingling affection, calm and gentle peace,\n Till the vex'd spirit seals with discontent\n A league of sorrow and of vanity,\n Built on a future which will never be!\n  \n     And yet I would resign the praise that now\n Makes my cheek crimson, and my pulses beat,\n Could I but deem that when my hand is cold,\n And my lip passionless, my songs would be\n Number'd mid the young poet's first delights;\n Read by the dark-eyed maiden in an hour\n Of moonlight, till her cheek shone with its tears;\n And murmur'd by the lover when his suit\n Calls upon poetry to breathe of love.\n I do not hope a sunshine burst of fame,\n My lyre asks but a wreath of fragile flowers.\n I have told passionate tales of breaking hearts,\n Of young cheeks fading even before the rose;\n My songs have been the mournful history\n Of woman's tenderness and woman's tears;\n I have touch'd but the spirit's gentlest chords, --\n Surely the fittest for my maiden hand; --\n And in their truth my immortality.\n  \n     Thou lovely and lone star, whose silver light,\n Like music o'er the waters, steals along\n The soften'd atmosphere; pale star, to thee\n I dedicate the lyre, whose influence\n I would have sink upon the heart like thine.\n  \n     In such an hour as this, the bosom turns\n Back to its early feelings; man forgets\n His stern ambition and his worldly cares,\n And woman loathes the petty vanities\n That mar her nature's beauty; like the dew,\n Shedding its sweetness o'er the sleeping flowers\n Till all their morning freshness is revived,\n Kindly affections, sad but yet sweet thoughts,\n Melt the cold eyes, long, long unused to weep.\n O lute of mine, that I shall wake no more!\n Such tearful music, linger on thy strings,\n Consecrate unto sorrow and to love;\n Thy truth, thy tenderness, be all thy fame!",
        "Revenge": "Ay, gaze upon her rose-wreathed hair,\n And gaze upon her smile;\n Seem as you drank the very air\n Her breath perfumed the while:\n\n And wake for her the gifted line,\n That wild and witching lay,\n And swear your heart is as a shrine,\n That only owns her sway.\n\n 'Tis well: I am revenged at last,--\n Mark you that scornful cheek,--\n The eye averted as you pass'd,\n Spoke more than words could speak.\n\n Ay, now by all the bitter tears\n That I have shed for thee,--\n The racking doubts, the burning fears,--\n Avenged they well may be--\n\n By the nights pass'd in sleepless care,\n The days of endless woe;\n All that you taught my heart to bear,\n All that yourself will know.\n\n I would not wish to see you laid\n Within an early tomb;\n I should forget how you betray'd,\n And only weep your doom:\n\n But this is fitting punishment,\n To live and love in vain,--\n Oh my wrung heart, be thou content,\n And feed upon his pain.\n\n Go thou and watch her lightest sigh,--\n Thine own it will not be;\n And bask beneath her sunny eye,--\n It will not turn on thee.\n\n 'Tis well: the rack, the chain, the wheel,\n Far better hadst thou proved;\n Ev'n I could almost pity feel,\n For thou art not beloved.",
        "Change": "And this is what is left of youth! . . .\nThere were two boys, who were bred up together,\nShared the same bed, and fed at the same board;\nEach tried the other's sport, from their first chase,\nYoung hunters of the butterfly and bee,\nTo when they followed the fleet hare, and tried\nThe swiftness of the bird. They lay beside\nThe silver trout stream, watching as the sun\nPlayed on the bubbles: shared each in the store\nOf either's garden: and together read\nOf him, the master of the desert isle,\nTill a low hut, a gun, and a canoe,\nBounded their wishes. Or if ever came\nA thought of future days, 'twas but to say\nThat they would share each other's lot, and do\nWonders, no doubt. But this was vain: they parted\nWith promises of long remembrance, words\nWhose kindness was the heart's, and those warm tears,\nHidden like shame by the young eyes which shed them,\nBut which are thought upon in after-years\nAs what we would give worlds to shed once more.\n\n  They met again, -- but different from themselves,\nAt least what each remembered of themselves:\nThe one proud as a soldier of his rank,\nAnd of his many battles: and the other\nProud of his Indian wealth, and of the skill\nAnd toil which gathered it; each with a brow\nAnd heart alike darkened by years and care.\nThey met with cold words, and yet colder looks:\nEach was changed in himself, and yet each thought\nThe other only changed, himself the same.\nAnd coldness bred dislike, and rivalry\nCame like the pestilence o'er some sweet thoughts\nThat lingered yet, healthy and beautiful,\nAmid dark and unkindly ones. And they,\nWhose boyhood had not known one jarring word,\nWere strangers in their age: if their eyes met,\n'Twas but to look contempt, and when they spoke,\nTheir speech was wormwood! . . . \n. . .

The consecrated blade upon my knees\n    Is Sato's ancient blade, still as it was,\n    Still razor-keen, still like a looking-glass\n    Unspotted by the centuries;\n    That flowering, silken, old embroidery, torn\n    From some court-lady's dress and round\n    The wooden scabbard bound and wound,\n    Can, tattered, still protect, faded adorn.\n\nMy Soul. Why should the imagination of a man\n    Long past his prime remember things that are\n    Emblematical of love and war?\n    Think of ancestral night that can,\n    If but imagination scorn the earth\n    And intellect its wandering\n    To this and that and t'other thing,\n    Deliver from the crime of death and birth.\n\nMy Self.

        "Crazy Jane Talks with the Bishop": "I met the Bishop on the road\n And much said he and I.\n `Those breasts are flat and fallen now\n Those veins must soon be dry;\n Live in a heavenly mansion,\n Not in some foul sty.'\n\n `Fair and foul are near of kin,\n And fair needs foul,' I cried.\n 'My friends are gone, but that's a truth\n Nor grave nor bed denied,\n Learned in bodily lowliness\n And in the heart's pride.\n\n `A woman can be proud and stiff\n When on love intent;\n But Love has pitched his mansion in\n The place of excrement;\n For nothing can be sole or whole\n That has not been rent.'",

        "No Second Troy": "Why should I blame her that she filled my days With misery, or that she would of late Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways, Or hurled the little streets upon the great, Had they but courage equal to desire? What could have made her peaceful with a mind That nobleness made simple as a fire, With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind That is not natural in an age like this, Being high and solitary and most stern? Why, what could she have done, being what she is? Was there another Troy for her to burn?",
        "The Song of the Happy Shepherd": "The woods of Arcady are dead, And over is their antique joy; Of old the world on dreaming fed; Grey Truth is now her painted toy; Yet still she turns her restless head: But O, sick children of the world, Of all the many changing things In dreary dancing past us whirled, To the cracked tune that Chronos sings, Words alone are certain good. Where are now the warring kings, Word be-mockers? -- By the RoodWhere are now the warring kings? An idle word is now their glory, By the stammering schoolboy said, Reading some entangled story: The kings of the old time are dead; The wandering earth herself may be Only a sudden flaming word, In clanging space a moment heard, Troubling the endless reverie. Then nowise worship dusty deeds, Nor seek, for this is also sooth, To hunger fiercely after truth, Lest all thy toiling only breeds New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then, No learning from the starry men, Who follow with the optic glass The whirling ways of stars that pass -- Seek, then, for this is also sooth, No word of theirs -- the cold star-bane Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain, And dead is all their human truth. Go gather by the humming sea Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell,And to its lips thy story tell, And they thy comforters will be, Rewarding in melodious guile Thy fretful words a little while, Till they shall singing fade in ruth And die a pearly brotherhood; For words alone are certain good: Sing, then, for this is also sooth. I must be gone: there is a grave Where daffodil and lily wave, And I would please the hapless faun, Buried under the sleepy ground, With mirthful songs before the dawn. His shouting days with mirth were crowned; And still I dream he treads the lawn, Walking ghostly in the dew, Pierced by my glad singing through, My songs of old earth's dreamy youth: But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou! For fair are poppies on the brow: Dream, dream, for this is also sooth.",
        "The Sad Shepherd": "There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend, And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming, Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming And humming sands, where windy surges wend: And he called loudly to the stars to bend From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they Among themselves laugh on and sing alway: And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story! The sea swept on and cried her old cry still, Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill. He fled the persecution of her glory And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping, Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening. But naught they heard, for they are always listening, The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping. And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend Sought once again the shore, and found a shell, And thought, I will my heavy story tell Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart; And my own tale again for me shall sing, And my own whispering words be comforting, And lo! my ancient burden may depart. Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim; But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.",
        "To an Isle in the Water": "Shy one, shy one, Shy one of my heart, She moves in the firelight Pensively apart. She carries in the dishes, And lays them in a row. To an isle in the water With her would I go. She carries in the candles, And lights the curtained room, Shy in the doorway And shy in the gloom; And shy as a rabbit, Helpful and shy. To an isle in the water With her would I fly.",
        "To Ireland in the Coming Times": "Know, that I would accounted be True brother of a company That sang, to sweeten Ireland's wrong, Ballad and story, rann and song; Nor be I any less of them, Because the red-rose-bordered hem Of her, whose history began Before God made the angelic clan, Trails all about the written page. When Time began to rant and rage The measure of her flying feet Made Ireland's heart begin to beat; And Time bade all his candles flare To light a measure here and there; And may the thoughts of Ireland brood Upon a measured quietude. Nor may I less be counted one With Davis, Mangan, Ferguson, Because, to him who ponders well, My rhymes more than their rhyming tell Of things discovered in the deep, Where only body's laid asleep. For the elemental creatures go About my table to and fro, That hurry from unmeasured mind To rant and rage in flood and wind; Yet he who treads in measured ways May surely barter gaze for gaze. Man ever journeys on with them After the red-rose-bordered hem. Ah, faeries, dancing under the moon, A Druid land, a Druid tune! While still I may, I write for you The love I lived, the dream I knew. From our birthday, until we die, Is but the winking of an eye; And we, our singing and our love, What measurer Time has lit above, And all benighted things that go About my table to and fro, Are passing on to where may be, In truth's consuming ecstasy, No place for love and dream at all; For God goes by with white footfall. I cast my heart into my rhymes, That you, in the dim coming times, May know how my heart went with them After the red-rose-bordered hem.",
        "The Everlasting Voices": "O sweet everlasting Voices, be still; Go to the guards of the heavenly fold And bid them wander obeying your will, Flame under flame, till Time be no more; Have you not heard that our hearts are old, That you call in birds, in wind on the hill, In shaken boughs, in tide on the shore? O sweet everlasting Voices, be still.",
        "The Fish": "Although you hide in the ebb and flow Of the pale tide when the moon has set, The people of coming days will know About the casting out of my net, And how you have leaped times out of mind Over the little silver cords, And think that you were hard and unkind, And blame you with many bitter words.",
        "He wishes his Beloved were Dead": "Were you but lying cold and dead, And lights were paling out of the West, You would come hither, and bend your head, And I would lay my head on your breast; And you would murmur tender words, Forgiving me, because you were dead: Nor would you rise and hasten away, Though you have the will of wild birds, But know your hair was bound and wound About the stars and moon and sun: O would, beloved, that you lay Under the dock-leaves in the ground, While lights were paling one by one.",
        "Never give all the Heart": "Never give all the heart, for love Will hardly seem worth thinking of To passionate women if it seem Certain, and they never dream That it fades out from kiss to kiss; For everything that's lovely is But a brief, dreamy, kind delight. O never give the heart outright, For they, for all smooth lips can say, Have given their hearts up to the play. And who could play it well enough If deaf and dumb and blind with love? He that made this knows all the cost, For he gave all his heart and lost.",
        "Reconciliation": "Some may have blamed you that you took away The verses that could move them on the day When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind With lightning, you went from me, and I could find Nothing to make a song about but kings, Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things That were like memories of you--but now We'll out, for the world lives as long ago; And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit, Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit. But, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone, My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone.",
        "September 1913": "What need you, being come to sense, But fumble in a greasy till And add the halfpence to the pence And prayer to shivering prayer, until You have dried the marrow from the bone; For men were born to pray and save: Romantic Ireland's dead and gone, It's with O'Leary in the grave. Yet they were of a different kind, The names that stilled your childish play, They have gone about the world like wind, But little time had they to pray For whom the hangman's rope was spun, And what, God help us, could they save? Romantic Ireland's dead and gone, It's with O'Leary in the grave. Was it for this the wild geese spread The grey wing upon every tide; For this that all that blood was shed, For this Edward Fitzgerald died, And Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone, All that delirium of the brave? Romantic Ireland's dead and gone, It's with O'Leary in the grave. Yet could we turn the years again, And call those exiles as they were In all their loneliness and pain, You'd cry, 'Some woman's yellow hair Has maddened every mother's son': They weighed so lightly what they gave. But let them be, they're dead and gone, They're with O'Leary in the grave.",
        "An Irish Airman foresees his Death": "I know that I shall meet my fate Somewhere among the clouds above; Those that I fight I do not hate, Those that I guard I do not love; My country is Kiltartan Cross, My countrymen Kiltartan's poor, No likely end could bring them loss Or leave them happier than before. Nor law, nor duty bade me fight, Nor public men, nor cheering crowds, A lonely impulse of delight Drove to this tumult in the clouds; I balanced all, brought all to mind, The years to come seemed waste of breath, A waste of breath the years behind In balance with this life, this death.",
        "On being asked for a War Poem": "I think it better that in times like these A poet's mouth be silent, for in truth We have no gift to set a statesman right; He has had enough of meddling who can please A young girl in the indolence of her youth, Or an old man upon a winter's night.",
        "Sixteen Dead Men": "O but we talked at large before The sixteen men were shot, But who can talk of give and take, What should be and what not While those dead men are loitering there To stir the boiling pot? You say that we should still the land Till Germany's overcome; But who is there to argue that Now Pearse is deaf and dumb? And is their logic to outweigh MacDonagh's bony thumb? How could you dream they'd listen That have an ear alone For those new comrades they have found, Lord Edward and Wolfe Tone, Or meddle with our give and take That converse bone to bone?",
        "The Rose Tree": "'O words are lightly spoken,' Said Pearse to Connolly, 'Maybe a breath of politic words Has withered our Rose Tree; Or maybe but a wind that blows Across the bitter sea.' 'It needs to be but watered,' James Connolly replied, 'To make the green come out again And spread on every side, And shake the blossom from the bud To be the garden's pride.' 'But where can we draw water,' Said Pearse to Connolly, 'When all the wells are parched away? O plain as plain can be There's nothing but our own red blood Can make a right Rose Tree.'",
        "On a Political Prisoner": "She that but little patience knew, From childhood on, had now so much A grey gull lost its fear and flew Down to her cell and there alit, And there endured her fingers' touch And from her fingers ate its bit. Did she in touching that lone wing Recall the years before her mind Became a bitter, an abstract thing, Her thought some popular enmity: Blind and leader of the blind Drinking the foul ditch where they lie? When long ago I saw her ride Under Ben Bulben to the meet, The beauty of her country-side With all youth's lonely wildness stirred, She seemed to have grown clean and sweet Like any rock-bred, sea-borne bird: Sea-borne, or balanced in the air When first it sprang out of the nest Upon some lofty rock to stare Upon the cloudy canopy, While under its storm-beaten breast Cried out the hollows of the sea.",
        "A Meditation in Time of War": "For one throb of the artery, While on that old grey stone I sat Under the old wind-broken tree, I knew that One is animate Mankind inanimate phantasy.",

        "Politics": "'In our time the destiny of man presents its meanings in political terms.'\n                                                                                                  THOMAS MANN.\n\n\n\nHow can I, that girl standing there,\nMy attention fix\nOn Roman or on Russian\nOr on Spanish politics,\nYet here's a travelled man that knows\nWhat he talks about,\nAnd there's a politician\nThat has both read and thought,\nAnd maybe what they say is true\nOf war and war's alarms,\nBut O that I were young again\nAnd held her in my arms.",
        "In Memory of Eva Gore-Booth and Con Markievicz": "The light of evening, Lissadell,\nGreat windows open to the south,\nTwo girls in silk kimonos, both\nBeautiful, one a gazelle.\nBut a raving autumn shears\nBlossom from the summer's wreath;\nThe older is condemned to death,\nPardoned, drags out lonely years\nConspiring among the ignorant.\nI know not what the younger dreams -\nSome vague Utopia - and she seems,\nWhen withered old and skeleton-gaunt,\nAn image of such politics.\nMany a time I think to seek\nOne or the other out and speak\nOf that old Georgian mansion, mix\nPictures of the mind, recall\nThat table and the talk of youth,\nTwo girls in silk kimonos, both\nBeautiful, one a gazelle.\n\nDear shadows, now you know it all,\nAll the folly of a fight\nWith a common wrong or right.\nThe innocent and the beautiful\nHave no enemy but time;\nArise and bid me strike a match\nAnd strike another till time catch;\nShould the conflagration climb,\nRun till all the sages know.\nWe the great gazebo built,\nThey convicted us of guilt;\nBid me strike a match and blow.",
        "A Coat": "I made my song a coat Covered with embroideries Out of old mythologies From heel to throat; But the fools caught it, Wore it in the world's eyes As though they'd wrought it. Song, let them take itFor there's more enterprise In walking naked.",
        "The Cap and Bells": "The jester walked in the garden:\n The garden had fallen still;\n He bade his soul rise upward\n And stand on her window-sill.\n\n It rose in a straight blue garment,\n When owls began to call:\n It had grown wise-tongued by thinking\n Of a quiet and light footfall;\n\n But the young queen would not listen;\n She rose in her pale night-gown;\n She drew in the heavy casement\n And pushed the latches down.\n\n He bade his heart go to her,\n When the owls called out no more;\n In a red and quivering garment\n It sang to her through the door.\n\n It had grown sweet-tongued by dreaming\n Of a flutter of flower-like hair;\n But she took up her fan from the table\n And waved it off on the air.\n\n 'I have cap and bells,' he pondered,\n 'I will send them to her and die';\n And when the morning whitened\n He left them where she went by.\n\n She laid them upon her bosom,\n Under a cloud of her hair,\n And her red lips sang them a love-song\n Till stars grew out of the air.\n\n She opened her door and her window,\n And the heart and the soul came through,\n To her right hand came the red one,\n To her left hand came the blue.\n\n They set up a noise like crickets,\n A chattering wise and sweet,\n And her hair was a folded flower\n And the quiet of love in her feet.",
        "Adam's Curse": "We sat together at one summer's end,\n That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,   \n And you and I, and talked of poetry.\n I said, 'A line will take us hours maybe;\n Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought,   \n Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.   \n Better go down upon your marrow-bones   \n And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones   \n Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;   \n For to articulate sweet sounds together\n Is to work harder than all these, and yet   \n Be thought an idler by the noisy set\n Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen   \n The martyrs call the world.'\n                                           And thereupon\n That beautiful mild woman for whose sake   \n There's many a one shall find out all heartache   \n On finding that her voice is sweet and low   \n Replied, 'To be born woman is to know--\n Although they do not talk of it at school--\n That we must labour to be beautiful.'\n I said, 'It's certain there is no fine thing   \n Since Adam's fall but needs much labouring.\n There have been lovers who thought love should be   \n So much compounded of high courtesy   \n That they would sigh and quote with learned looks   \n Precedents out of beautiful old books;   \n Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.'\n\n We sat grown quiet at the name of love;   \n We saw the last embers of daylight die,   \n And in the trembling blue-green of the sky   \n A moon, worn as if it had been a shell   \n Washed by time's waters as they rose and fell   \n About the stars and broke in days and years.\n\n I had a thought for no one's but your ears:   \n That you were beautiful, and that I strove   \n To love you in the old high way of love;\n That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown   \n As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.",
        "The Fascination of What's Difficult": "The fascination of what's difficult\n Has dried the sap out of my veins, and rent\n Spontaneous joy and natural content\n Out of my heart. There's something ails our colt\n That must, as if it had not holy blood\n Nor on Olympus leaped from cloud to cloud,\n Shiver under the lash, strain, sweat and jolt\n As though it dragged road metal. My curse on plays\n That have to be set up in fifty ways,\n On the day's war with every knave and dolt,\n Theatre business, management of men.\n I swear before the dawn comes round again\n I'll find the stable and pull out the bolt.",
        "Easter, 1916": "I have met them at close of day   \n Coming with vivid faces\n From counter or desk among grey   \n Eighteenth-century houses.\n I have passed with a nod of the head   \n Or polite meaningless words,   \n Or have lingered awhile and said   \n Polite meaningless words,\n And thought before I had done   \n Of a mocking tale or a gibe   \n To please a companion\n Around the fire at the club,   \n Being certain that they and I   \n But lived where motley is worn:   \n All changed, changed utterly:   \n A terrible beauty is born.\n\n That woman's days were spent   \n In ignorant good-will,\n Her nights in argument\n Until her voice grew shrill.\n What voice more sweet than hers   \n When, young and beautiful,   \n She rode to harriers?\n This man had kept a school   \n And rode our winged horse;   \n This other his helper and friend   \n Was coming into his force;\n He might have won fame in the end,   \n So sensitive his nature seemed,   \n So daring and sweet his thought.\n This other man I had dreamed\n A drunken, vainglorious lout.\n He had done most bitter wrong\n To some who are near my heart,   \n Yet I number him in the song;\n He, too, has resigned his part\n In the casual comedy;\n He, too, has been changed in his turn,   \n Transformed utterly:\n A terrible beauty is born.\n\n Hearts with one purpose alone   \n Through summer and winter seem   \n Enchanted to a stone\n To trouble the living stream.\n The horse that comes from the road,   \n The rider, the birds that range   \n From cloud to tumbling cloud,   \n Minute by minute they change;   \n A shadow of cloud on the stream   \n Changes minute by minute;   \n A horse-hoof slides on the brim,   \n And a horse plashes within it;   \n The long-legged moor-hens dive,   \n And hens to moor-cocks call;   \n Minute by minute they live:   \n The stone's in the midst of all.\n\n Too long a sacrifice\n Can make a stone of the heart.   \n O when may it suffice?\n That is Heaven's part, our part   \n To murmur name upon name,   \n As a mother names her child   \n When sleep at last has come   \n On limbs that had run wild.   \n What is it but nightfall?\n No, no, not night but death;   \n Was it needless death after all?\n For England may keep faith   \n For all that is done and said.   \n We know their dream; enough\n To know they dreamed and are dead;   \n And what if excess of love   \n Bewildered them till they died?   \n I write it out in a verse--\n MacDonagh and MacBride   \n And Connolly and Pearse\n Now and in time to be,\n Wherever green is worn,\n Are changed, changed utterly:   \n A terrible beauty is born.",
        "Down By the Salley Gardens": "Down by the salley gardens\n    my love and I did meet;\n She passed the salley gardens\n    with little snow-white feet.\n She bid me take love easy,\n    as the leaves grow on the tree;\n But I, being young and foolish,\n    with her would not agree.\n\n In a field by the river\n    my love and I did stand,\n And on my leaning shoulder\n    she laid her snow-white hand.\n She bid me take life easy,\n    as the grass grows on the weirs;\n But I was young and foolish,\n    and now am full of tears.",
        "To the Rose upon the Rood of Time": "Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days!\n Come near me, while I sing the ancient ways:\n Cuchulain battling with the bitter tide;\n The Druid, grey, wood-nurtured, quiet-eyed,\n Who cast round Fergus dreams, and ruin untold;\n And thine own sadness, whereof stars, grown old\n In dancing silver-sandalled on the sea,\n Sing in their high and lonely melody.\n Come near, that no more blinded by man's fate,\n I find under the boughs of love and hate,\n In all poor foolish things that live a day,\n Eternal beauty wandering on her way.\n\n Come near, come near, come near--Ah, leave me still\n A little space for the rose-breath to fill!\n Lest I no more hear common things that crave;\n The weak worm hiding down in its small cave,\n The field-mouse running by me in the grass,\n And heavy mortal hopes that toil and pass;\n But seek alone to hear the strange things said\n By God to the bright hearts of those long dead,\n And learn to chaunt a tongue men do not know.\n Come near; I would, before my time to go,\n Sing of old Eire and the ancient ways:\n Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days.",
        "The Lake Isle of Innisfree": "I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,\n And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;\n Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,\n And live alone in the bee-loud glade.\n\n And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,\n Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;\n There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,\n And evening full of the linnet's wings.\n\n I will arise and go now, for always night and day\n I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;\n While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,\n I hear it in the deep heart's core.",
        "The Sorrow of Love": "The brawling of a sparrow in the eaves,   \n The brilliant moon and all the milky sky,   \n And all that famous harmony of leaves,   \n Had blotted out man's image and his cry.\n\n A girl arose that had red mournful lips\n And seemed the greatness of the world in tears,   \n Doomed like Odysseus and the labouring ships   \n And proud as Priam murdered with his peers;\n\n Arose, and on the instant clamorous eaves,   \n A climbing moon upon an empty sky,   \n And all that lamentation of the leaves,   \n Could but compose man's image and his cry.",
        "The Second Coming": "Turning and turning in the widening gyre   \n The falcon cannot hear the falconer;\n Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\n Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,\n The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   \n The ceremony of innocence is drowned;\n The best lack all conviction, while the worst   \n Are full of passionate intensity.\n\n Surely some revelation is at hand;\n Surely the Second Coming is at hand.   \n The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out   \n When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi\n Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert   \n A shape with lion body and the head of a man,   \n A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   \n Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it   \n Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.   \n The darkness drops again; but now I know   \n That twenty centuries of stony sleep\n Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,   \n And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,   \n Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?",
        "To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Nothing": "Now all the truth is out,\n Be secret and take defeat\n From any brazen throat,\n For how can you compete,\n Being honor bred, with one\n Who were it proved he lies\n Were neither shamed in his own\n Nor in his neighbors' eyes;\n Bred to a harder thing\n Than Triumph, turn away\n And like a laughing string\n Whereon mad fingers play\n Amid a place of stone,\n Be secret and exult,\n Because of all things known\n That is most difficult.",
        "The Magi": "Now as at all times I can see in the mind's eye,\n In their stiff, painted clothes, the pale unsatisfied ones\n Appear and disappear in the blue depths of the sky\n With all their ancient faces like rain-beaten stones,\n And all their helms of silver hovering side by side,\n And all their eyes still fixed, hoping to find once more,\n Being by Calvary's turbulence unsatisfied,\n The uncontrollable mystery on the bestial floor.",
        "A Prayer for My Daughter": "Once more the storm is howling, and half hid   Under this cradle-hood and coverlid   My child sleeps on. There is no obstacle   But Gregory's Wood and one bare hill   Whereby the haystack and roof-levelling wind,   Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;   And for an hour I have walked and prayed   Because of the great gloom that is in my mind.  I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour, And heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower, And under the arches of the bridge, and scream In the elms above the flooded stream; Imagining in excited reverie That the future years had come   Dancing to a frenzied drum   Out of the murderous innocence of the sea.  May she be granted beauty, and yet not   Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,   Or hers before a looking-glass; for such,   Being made beautiful overmuch,   Consider beauty a sufficient end,   Lose natural kindness, and maybe   The heart-revealing intimacy   That chooses right, and never find a friend.  Helen, being chosen, found life flat and dull,   And later had much trouble from a fool;   While that great Queen that rose out of the spray,   Being fatherless, could have her way,   Yet chose a bandy-legged smith for man.   It's certain that fine women eat   A crazy salad with their meat   Whereby the Horn of Plenty is undone.  In courtesy I'd have her chiefly learned;   Hearts are not had as a gift, but hearts are earned   By those that are not entirely beautiful.   Yet many, that have played the fool For beauty's very self, has charm made wise;   And many a poor man that has roved,   Loved and thought himself beloved,   From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes.  May she become a flourishing hidden tree,   That all her thoughts may like the linnet be,   And have no business but dispensing round   Their magnanimities of sound;   Nor but in merriment begin a chase,   Nor but in merriment a quarrel.   Oh, may she live like some green laurel   Rooted in one dear perpetual place.  My mind, because the minds that I have loved,   The sort of beauty that I have approved,   Prosper but little, has dried up of late,   Yet knows that to be choked with hate   May well be of all evil chances chief.   If there's no hatred in a mind   Assault and battery of the wind   Can never tear the linnet from the leaf.  An intellectual hatred is the worst,   So let her think opinions are accursed.   Have I not seen the loveliest woman born Out of the mouth of Plenty's horn,   Because of her opinionated mind   Barter that horn and every good   By quiet natures understood   For an old bellows full of angry wind?  Considering that, all hatred driven hence,   The soul recovers radical innocence   And learns at last that it is self-delighting, Self-appeasing, self-affrighting,   And that its own sweet will is heaven's will,   She can, though every face should scowl   And every windy quarter howl   Or every bellows burst, be happy still.  And may her bridegroom bring her to a house   Where all's accustomed, ceremonious;   For arrogance and hatred are the wares   Peddled in the thoroughfares.   How but in custom and in ceremony   Are innocence and beauty born?   Ceremony's a name for the rich horn,   And custom for the spreading laurel tree.",
        "Leda and the Swan": "A sudden blow: the great wings beating still\n Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed\n By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,\n He holds her helpless breast upon his breast.\n\n How can those terrified vague fingers push\n The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?\n And how can body, laid in that white rush,\n But feel the strange heart beating where it lies?\n\n A shudder in the loins engenders there\n The broken wall, the burning roof and tower\n And Agamemnon dead.\n                                   Being so caught up,\n So mastered by the brute blood of the air,\n Did she put on his knowledge with his power\n Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?"

Ful worthy was he in his lordes werre, And thereto hadde he riden, no man ferre, As wel in cristendom as in hethenesse, And evere honoured for his worthynesse. At Alisaundre he was whan it was wonne; Ful ofte tyme he hadde the bord bigonne Aboven alle nacions in Pruce. In Lettow hadde he reysed and in Ruce,-- No cristen man so ofte of his degree. In Gernade at the seege eek hadde he be Of Algezir, and riden in Belmarye. At Lyeys was he, and at Satalye, Whan they were wonne; and in the Grete See At many a noble armee hadde he be.

This ilke worthy knyght hadde been also Somtyme with the lord of Palatye Agayn another hethen in Turkye; And evermoore he hadde a sovereyn prys. And though that he were worthy, he was wys, And of his port as meeke as is a mayde. He nevere yet no vileynye ne sayde, In al his lyf, unto no maner wight. He was a verray, parfit, gentil knyght.  But for to tellen yow of his array, His hors weren goode, but he was nat gay; Of fustian he wered a gypon Al bismotered with his habergeon; For he was late y-come from his viage, And wente for to doon his pilgrymage.  With hym ther was his sone, a yong Squier, A lovyere and a lusty bacheler, With lokkes crulle as they were leyd in presse. Of twenty yeer of age he was, I gesse. Of his stature he was of evene lengthe, And wonderly delyvere and of greet strengthe. And he hadde been somtyme in chyvachie In Flaundres, in Artoys, and Pycardie, And born hym weel, as of so litel space, In hope to stonden in his lady grace. Embrouded was he, as it were a meede Al ful of fresshe floures whyte and reede. Syngynge he was, or floytynge, al the day; He was as fressh as is the month of May. Short was his gowne, with sleves longe and wyde; Wel koude he sitte on hors and faire ryde; He koude songes make and wel endite, Juste and eek daunce, and weel purtreye and write. So hoote he lovede that by nyghtertale He sleep namoore than dooth a nyghtyngale. Curteis he was, lowely and servysable, And carf biforn his fader at the table.  A Yeman hadde he and servantz namo At that tyme, for hym liste ride soo; And he was clad in cote and hood of grene. A sheef of pecock arwes bright and kene, Under his belt he bar ful thriftily-- Wel koude he dresse his takel yemanly; His arwes drouped noght with fetheres lowe-- And in his hand he baar a myghty bowe. A not-heed hadde he, with a broun visage. Of woodecraft wel koude he al the usage. Upon his arm he baar a gay bracer, And by his syde a swerd and a bokeler, And on that oother syde a gay daggere, Harneised wel and sharp as point of spere; A Cristophere on his brest of silver sheene. An horn he bar, the bawdryk was of grene. A forster was he, soothly as I gesse.  Ther was also a Nonne, a Prioresse, That of hir smylyng was ful symple and coy; Hire gretteste ooth was but by seinte Loy, And she was cleped madame Eglentyne. Ful weel she soong the service dyvyne, Entuned in hir nose ful semely; And Frenssh she spak ful faire and fetisly, After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe, For Frenssh of Parys was to hire unknowe. At mete wel y-taught was she with-alle: She leet no morsel from hir lippes falle, Ne wette hir fyngres in hir sauce depe. Wel koude she carie a morsel and wel kepe That no drope ne fille upon hire brist; In curteisie was set ful muchel hir list. Hire over-lippe wyped she so clene That in hir coppe ther was no ferthyng sene Of grece, whan she dronken hadde hir draughte. Ful semely after hir mete she raughte. And sikerly she was of greet desport, And ful plesaunt and amyable of port, And peyned hire to countrefete cheere Of court, and been estatlich of manere, And to ben holden digne of reverence. But for to speken of hire conscience, She was so charitable and so pitous She wolde wepe if that she saugh a mous Kaught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde. Of smale houndes hadde she, that she fedde With rosted flessh, or milk and wastel breed; But soore wepte she if oon of hem were deed, Or if men smoot it with a yerde smerte; And al was conscience and tendre herte.  Ful semyly hir wympul pynched was; Hire nose tretys, her eyen greye as glas, Hir mouth ful smal and ther-to softe and reed; But sikerly she hadde a fair forheed; It was almoost a spanne brood, I trowe; For, hardily, she was nat undergrowe. Ful fetys was hir cloke, as I was war; Of smal coral aboute hire arm she bar A peire of bedes, gauded al with grene, And ther-on heng a brooch of gold ful sheene, On which ther was first write a crowned A, And after, Amor vincit omnia.  Another Nonne with hire hadde she, That was hire chapeleyne, and Preestes thre.  A Monk ther was, a fair for the maistrie, An outridere, that lovede venerie; A manly man, to been an abbot able. Ful many a deyntee hors hadde he in stable; And whan he rood, men myghte his brydel heere Gynglen in a whistlynge wynd als cleere, And eek as loude, as dooth the chapel belle, Ther as this lord was kepere of the celle. The reule of seint Maure or of seint Beneit, By-cause that it was old and som-del streit,-- This ilke Monk leet olde thynges pace, And heeld after the newe world the space. He yaf nat of that text a pulled hen That seith that hunters ben nat hooly men, Ne that a monk, whan he is recchelees, Is likned til a fissh that is waterlees,-- This is to seyn, a monk out of his cloystre. But thilke text heeld he nat worth an oystre; And I seyde his opinioun was good. What sholde he studie and make hymselven wood, Upon a book in cloystre alwey to poure, Or swynken with his handes and laboure, As Austyn bit? How shal the world be served? Lat Austyn have his swynk to him reserved. Therfore he was a prikasour aright: Grehoundes he hadde, as swift as fowel in flight; Of prikyng and of huntyng for the hare Was al his lust, for no cost wolde he spare. I seigh his sleves y-purfiled at the hond With grys, and that the fyneste of a lond; And for to festne his hood under his chyn He hadde of gold y-wroght a curious pyn; A love-knotte in the gretter ende ther was. His heed was balled, that shoon as any glas, And eek his face, as he hadde been enoynt. He was a lord ful fat and in good poynt; His eyen stepe, and rollynge in his heed, That stemed as a forneys of a leed; His bootes souple, his hors in greet estaat. Now certeinly he was a fair prelaat. He was nat pale, as a forpyned goost: A fat swan loved he best of any roost. His palfrey was as broun as is a berye.  A Frere ther was, a wantowne and a merye, A lymytour, a ful solempne man. In alle the ordres foure is noon that kan So muchel of daliaunce and fair langage. He hadde maad ful many a mariage Of yonge wommen at his owene cost. Unto his ordre he was a noble post. Ful wel biloved and famulier was he With frankeleyns over al in his contree, And eek with worthy wommen of the toun; For he hadde power of confessioun, As seyde hym-self, moore than a curat, For of his ordre he was licenciat. Ful swetely herde he confessioun, And plesaunt was his absolucioun. He was an esy man to yeve penaunce There as he wiste to have a good pitaunce; For unto a povre ordre for to yive Is signe that a man is wel y-shryve; For, if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt He wiste that a man was repentaunt; For many a man so hard is of his herte He may nat wepe al-thogh hym soore smerte. Therfore in stede of wepynge and preyeres Men moote yeve silver to the povre freres. His typet was ay farsed full of knyves And pynnes, for to yeven faire wyves. And certeinly he hadde a murye note: Wel koude he synge and pleyen on a rote; Of yeddynges he baar outrely the pris. His nekke whit was as the flour-de-lys; Ther-to he strong was as a champioun. He knew the tavernes wel in every toun, And everich hostiler and tappestere Bet than a lazar or a beggestere; For unto swich a worthy man as he Acorded nat, as by his facultee, To have with sike lazars aqueyntaunce; It is nat honest, it may nat avaunce For to deelen with no swich poraille, But al with riche and selleres of vitaille. And over-al, ther as profit sholde arise, Curteis he was and lowely of servyse. Ther nas no man nowher so vertuous. He was the beste beggere in his hous; [And yaf a certeyn ferme for the graunt, Noon of his brethren cam ther in his haunt;] For thogh a wydwe hadde noght a sho, So plesaunt was his In principio, Yet wolde he have a ferthyng er he wente: His purchas was wel bettre than his rente. And rage he koude, as it were right a whelpe. In love-dayes ther koude he muchel helpe, For there he was nat lyk a cloysterer With a thredbare cope, as is a povre scoler, But he was lyk a maister, or a pope; Of double worstede was his semycope, That rounded as a belle, out of the presse. Somwhat he lipsed for his wantownesse, To make his Englissh sweete upon his tonge; And in his harpyng, whan that he hadde songe, His eyen twynkled in his heed aryght As doon the sterres in the frosty nyght. This worthy lymytour was cleped Huberd.  A Marchant was ther with a forked berd, In motteleye, and hye on horse he sat; Upon his heed a Flaundryssh bevere hat; His bootes clasped faire and fetisly. His resons he spak ful solempnely, Sownynge alway thencrees of his wynnyng. He wolde the see were kept for any thing Bitwixe Middelburgh and Orewelle. Wel koude he in eschaunge sheeldes selle. This worthy man ful wel his wit bisette; Ther wiste no wight that he was in dette, So estatly was he of his gouvernaunce, With his bargaynes and with his chevyssaunce. For sothe he was a worthy man with-alle, But, sooth to seyn, I noot how men hym calle.  A Clerk ther was of Oxenford also, That unto logyk hadde longe y-go. As leene was his hors as is a rake, And he nas nat right fat, I undertake, But looked holwe, and ther-to sobrely. Ful thredbare was his overeste courtepy; For he hadde geten hym yet no benefice, Ne was so worldly for to have office; For hym was levere have at his beddes heed Twenty bookes, clad in blak or reed, Of Aristotle and his philosophie, Than robes riche, or fithele, or gay sautrie. But al be that he was a philosophre, Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre; But al that he myghte of his freendes hente On bookes and on lernynge he it spente, And bisily gan for the soules preye Of hem that yaf hym wher-with to scoleye. Of studie took he moost cure and moost heede. Noght o word spak he moore than was neede; And that was seyd in forme and reverence, And short and quyk and ful of hy sentence. Sownynge in moral vertu was his speche; And gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche.  A Sergeant of the Lawe, war and wys, That often hadde been at the Parvys, Ther was also, ful riche of excellence. Discreet he was, and of greet reverence-- He semed swich, his wordes weren so wise. Justice he was ful often in assise, By patente, and by pleyn commissioun. For his science and for his heigh renoun, Of fees and robes hadde he many oon. So greet a purchasour was nowher noon: Al was fee symple to hym in effect; His purchasyng myghte nat been infect. Nowher so bisy a man as he ther nas, And yet he semed bisier than he was. In termes hadde he caas and doomes alle That from the tyme of kyng William were falle. Ther-to he koude endite and make a thyng, Ther koude no wight pynche at his writyng; And every statut koude he pleyn by rote. He rood but hoomly in a medlee cote, Girt with a ceint of silk, with barres smale; Of his array telle I no lenger tale.  A Frankeleyn was in his compaignye. Whit was his berd as is the dayesye; Of his complexioun he was sangwyn. Wel loved he by the morwe a sop in wyn; To lyven in delit was evere his wone, For he was Epicurus owene sone, That heeld opinioun that pleyn delit Was verraily felicitee parfit. An housholdere, and that a greet, was he; Seint Julian he was in his contree. His breed, his ale, was alweys after oon; A bettre envyned man was nowher noon. Withoute bake mete was nevere his hous, Of fissh and flessh, and that so plentevous, It snewed in his hous of mete and drynke, Of alle deyntees that men koude thynke, After the sondry sesons of the yeer; So chaunged he his mete and his soper. Ful many a fat partrich hadde he in muwe, And many a breem and many a luce in stuwe. Wo was his cook but if his sauce were Poynaunt and sharp, and redy al his geere. His table dormant in his halle alway Stood redy covered al the longe day. At sessiouns ther was he lord and sire; Ful ofte tyme he was knyght of the shire. An anlaas, and a gipser al of silk, Heeng at his girdel, whit as morne milk. A shirreve hadde he been, and a countour; Was nowher such a worthy vavasour.  An Haberdasshere, and a Carpenter, A Webbe, a Dyere, and a Tapycer,-- And they were clothed alle in o lyveree Of a solempne and a greet fraternitee. Ful fressh and newe hir geere apiked was; Hir knyves were chaped noght with bras, But al with silver; wroght ful clene and weel Hire girdles and hir pouches everydeel. Wel semed ech of hem a fair burgeys To sitten in a yeldehalle, on a deys. Everich, for the wisdom that he kan, Was shaply for to been an alderman; For catel hadde they ynogh and rente, And eek hir wyves wolde it wel assente, And elles certeyn were they to blame. It is ful fair to been y-cleped Madame, And goon to vigilies al bifore, And have a mantel roialliche y-bore.  A Cook they hadde with hem for the nones, To boille the chiknes with the marybones, And poudre-marchant tart, and galyngale. Wel koude he knowe a draughte of Londoun ale. He koude rooste, and sethe, and broille, and frye, Maken mortreux, and wel bake a pye. But greet harm was it, as it thoughte me, That on his shyne a mormal hadde he; For blankmanger, that made he with the beste.  A Shipman was ther, wonynge fer by weste; For aught I woot he was of Dertemouthe. He rood upon a rouncy, as he kouthe, In a gowne of faldyng to the knee. A daggere hangynge on a laas hadde he Aboute his nekke, under his arm adoun. The hoote somer hadde maad his hewe al broun; And certeinly he was a good felawe. Ful many a draughte of wyn hadde he y-drawe Fro Burdeux-ward, whil that the chapman sleep. Of nyce conscience took he no keep. If that he faught and hadde the hyer hond, By water he sente hem hoom to every lond. But of his craft to rekene wel his tydes, His stremes, and his daungers hym bisides, His herberwe and his moone, his lode-menage, Ther nas noon swich from Hulle to Cartage. Hardy he was and wys to undertake; With many a tempest hadde his berd been shake. He knew alle the havenes, as they were, From Gootlond to the Cape of Fynystere, And every cryke in Britaigne and in Spayne. His barge y-cleped was the Maudelayne.  With us ther was a Doctour of Phisik; In all this world ne was ther noon hym lik, To speke of phisik and of surgerye; For he was grounded in astronomye. He kepte his pacient a ful greet deel In houres, by his magyk natureel. Wel koude he fortunen the ascendent Of his ymages for his pacient. He knew the cause of everich maladye, Were it of hoot, or cold, or moyste, or drye, And where they engendred and of what humour. He was a verray, parfit praktisour; The cause y-knowe, and of his harm the roote, Anon he yaf the sike man his boote. Ful redy hadde he his apothecaries To sende him drogges and his letuaries; For ech of hem made oother for to wynne, Hir frendshipe nas nat newe to bigynne. Wel knew he the olde Esculapius, And De{\"y}scorides, and eek Rufus, Old Ypocras, Haly, and Galyen, Serapion, Razis, and Avycen, Averrois, Damascien, and Constantyn, Bernard, and Gatesden, and Gilbertyn. Of his diete mesurable was he, For it was of no superfluitee, But of greet norissyng and digestible. His studie was but litel on the Bible. In sangwyn and in pers he clad was al, Lyned with taffata and with sendal. And yet he was but esy of dispence; He kepte that he wan in pestilence. For gold in phisik is a cordial; Therfore he lovede gold in special.  A Good Wif was ther of biside Bathe, But she was som-del deef, and that was scathe. Of clooth-makyng she hadde swich an haunt She passed hem of Ypres and of Gaunt. In al the parisshe wif ne was ther noon That to the offrynge bifore hire sholde goon; And if ther dide, certeyn so wrooth was she That she was out of alle charitee. Hir coverchiefs ful fyne weren of ground; I dorste swere they weyeden ten pound That on a Sonday weren upon hir heed. Hir hosen weren of fyn scarlet reed, Ful streite y-teyd, and shoes ful moyste and newe. Boold was hir face, and fair, and reed of hewe. She was a worthy womman al hir lyve; Housbondes at chirche dore she hadde fyve, Withouten oother compaignye in youthe; But ther-of nedeth nat to speke as nowthe. And thries hadde she been at Jerusalem; She hadde passed many a straunge strem; At Rome she hadde been, and at Boloigne, In Galice at Seint Jame, and at Coloigne. She koude muchel of wandrynge by the weye. Gat-tothed was she, soothly for to seye. Upon an amblere esily she sat, Y-wympled wel, and on hir heed an hat As brood as is a bokeler or a targe; A foot-mantel aboute hir hipes large, And on hire feet a paire of spores sharpe. In felaweshipe wel koude she laughe and carpe; Of remedies of love she knew per chaunce, For she koude of that art the olde daunce.  A good man was ther of religioun, And was a povre Person of a Toun; But riche he was of hooly thoght and werk. He was also a lerned man, a clerk, That Cristes Gospel trewely wolde preche; His parisshens devoutly wolde he teche. Benygne he was, and wonder diligent, And in adversitee ful pacient; And swich he was y-preved ofte sithes. Ful looth were hym to cursen for his tithes, But rather wolde he yeven, out of doute, Unto his povre parisshens aboute, Of his offryng and eek of his substaunce; He koude in litel thyng have suffisaunce. Wyd was his parisshe, and houses fer asonder, But he ne lafte nat, for reyn ne thonder, In siknesse nor in meschief to visite The ferreste in his parisshe, muche and lite, Upon his feet, and in his hand a staf. This noble ensample to his sheep he yaf, That first he wroghte and afterward he taughte. Out of the gospel he tho wordes caughte; And this figure he added eek therto, That if gold ruste, what shal iren doo? For if a preest be foul, on whom we truste, No wonder is a lewed man to ruste; And shame it is, if a prest take keep, A shiten shepherde and a clene sheep. Wel oghte a preest ensample for to yive By his clennesse how that his sheep sholde lyve. He sette nat his benefice to hyre And leet his sheep encombred in the myre, And ran to Londoun, unto Seinte Poules, To seken hym a chaunterie for soules, Or with a bretherhed to been withholde; But dwelte at hoom and kepte wel his folde, So that the wolf ne made it nat myscarie; He was a shepherde, and noght a mercenarie. And though he hooly were and vertuous, He was to synful man nat despitous, Ne of his speche daungerous ne digne, But in his techyng discreet and benygne. To drawen folk to hevene by fairnesse, By good ensample, this was his bisynesse. But it were any persone obstinat, What so he were, of heigh or lough estat, Hym wolde he snybben sharply for the nonys. A bettre preest I trowe that nowher noon ys. He waited after no pompe and reverence, Ne maked him a spiced conscience; But Cristes loore and his apostles twelve He taughte, but first he folwed it hymselve.  With hym ther was a Plowman, was his brother, That hadde y-lad of dong ful many a fother; A trewe swynkere and a good was he, Lyvynge in pees and parfit charitee. God loved he best, with al his hoole herte, At alle tymes, thogh him gamed or smerte. And thanne his neighebor right as hymselve. He wolde thresshe, and therto dyke and delve, For Cristes sake, for every povre wight, Withouten hire, if it lay in his myght. His tithes payede he ful faire and wel, Bothe of his propre swynk and his catel. In a tabard he rood upon a mere.  Ther was also a Reve and a Millere, A Somnour and a Pardoner also, A Maunciple, and myself,--ther were namo.  The Millere was a stout carl for the nones; Ful byg he was of brawn and eek of bones. That proved wel, for over-al, ther he cam, At wrastlynge he wolde have alwey the ram. He was short-sholdred, brood, a thikke knarre; Ther nas no dore that he nolde heve of harre, Or breke it at a rennyng with his heed. His berd as any sowe or fox was reed, And therto brood, as though it were a spade. Upon the cop right of his nose he hade A werte, and thereon stood a toft of herys, Reed as the brustles of a sowes erys; His nosethirles blake were and wyde. A swerd and a bokeler bar he by his syde. His mouth as greet was as a greet forneys; He was a janglere and a goliardeys, And that was moost of synne and harlotries. Wel koude he stelen corn and tollen thries; And yet he hadde a thombe of gold, pardee. A whit cote and a blew hood wered he. A baggepipe wel koude he blowe and sowne, And therwithal he broghte us out of towne.  A gentil Maunciple was ther of a temple, Of which achatours myghte take exemple For to be wise in byynge of vitaille; For, wheither that he payde or took by taille, Algate he wayted so in his achaat That he was ay biforn and in good staat. Now is nat that of God a ful fair grace, That swich a lewed mannes wit shal pace The wisdom of an heep of lerned men? Of maistres hadde he mo than thries ten, That weren of lawe expert and curious, Of whiche ther weren a duszeyne in that hous Worthy to been stywardes of rente and lond Of any lord that is in Engelond, To maken hym lyve by his propre good, In honour dettelees, but if he were wood, Or lyve as scarsly as hym list desire; And able for to helpen al a shire In any caas that myghte falle or happe; And yet this Manciple sette hir aller cappe  The Reve was a sclendre colerik man. His berd was shave as ny as ever he kan; His heer was by his erys round y-shorn; His top was dokked lyk a preest biforn. Ful longe were his legges and ful lene, Y-lyk a staf, ther was no calf y-sene. Wel koude he kepe a gerner and a bynne; Ther was noon auditour koude on him wynne. Wel wiste he, by the droghte and by the reyn, The yeldynge of his seed and of his greyn. His lordes sheep, his neet, his dayerye, His swyn, his hors, his stoor, and his pultrye, Was hoolly in this reves governyng; And by his covenant yaf the rekenyng Syn that his lord was twenty yeer of age; There koude no man brynge hym in arrerage. There nas baillif, ne hierde, nor oother hyne, That he ne knew his sleighte and his covyne; They were adrad of hym as of the deeth. His wonyng was ful fair upon an heeth; With grene trees shadwed was his place. He koude bettre than his lord purchace; Ful riche he was a-stored pryvely. His lord wel koude he plesen subtilly, To yeve and lene hym of his owene good, And have a thank, and yet a cote and hood. In youthe he hadde lerned a good myster; He was a wel good wrighte, a carpenter. This Reve sat upon a ful good stot, That was al pomely grey, and highte Scot. A long surcote of pers upon he hade, And by his syde he baar a rusty blade. Of Northfolk was this Reve of which I telle, Biside a toun men clepen Baldeswelle. Tukked he was as is a frere, aboute. And evere he rood the hyndreste of oure route.  A Somonour was ther with us in that place, That hadde a fyr-reed cherubynnes face, For sawcefleem he was, with eyen narwe. As hoot he was and lecherous as a sparwe, With scaled browes blake and piled berd,-- Of his visage children were aferd. Ther nas quyk-silver, lytarge, ne brymstoon, Boras, ceruce, ne oille of tartre noon, Ne oynement that wolde clense and byte, That hym myghte helpen of his whelkes white, Nor of the knobbes sittynge on his chekes. Wel loved he garleek, oynons, and eek lekes, And for to drynken strong wyn, reed as blood. Thanne wolde he speke, and crie as he were wood. And whan that he wel dronken hadde the wyn, Than wolde he speke no word but Latyn. A fewe termes hadde he, two or thre, That he had lerned out of som decree,-- No wonder is, he herde it al the day; And eek ye knowen wel how that a jay Kan clepen \"Watte\" as wel as kan the pope. But whoso koude in oother thyng hym grope, Thanne hadde he spent al his philosophie; Ay \"Questio quid juris\" wolde he crie. He was a gentil harlot and a kynde; A bettre felawe sholde men noght fynde. He wolde suffre for a quart of wyn A good felawe to have his concubyn A twelf month, and excuse hym atte fulle; And prively a fynch eek koude he pulle. And if he foond owher a good felawe, He wolde techen him to have noon awe, In swich caas, of the erchedekenes curs, But if a mannes soule were in his purs; For in his purs he sholde y-punysshed be: \"Purs is the erchedekenes helle,\" seyde he. But wel I woot he lyed right in dede. Of cursyng oghte ech gilty man him drede, For curs wol slee, right as assoillyng savith; And also war him of a Significavit. In daunger hadde he at his owene gise The yonge girles of the diocise, And knew hir conseil, and was al hir reed. A gerland hadde he set upon his heed, As greet as it were for an ale-stake; A bokeleer hadde he maad him of a cake.  With hym ther rood a gentil Pardoner Of Rouncivale, his freend and his compeer, That streight was comen fro the court of Rome. Ful loude he soong, \"Com hider, love, to me!\" This Somonour bar to hym a stif burdoun; Was nevere trompe of half so greet a soun. This Pardoner hadde heer as yelow as wex, But smothe it heeng as dooth a strike of flex; By ounces henge his lokkes that he hadde, And therwith he his shuldres overspradde. But thynne it lay, by colpons, oon and oon; But hood, for jolitee, wered he noon, For it was trussed up in his walet. Hym thoughte he rood al of the newe jet; Dischevelee, save his cappe, he rood al bare. Swiche glarynge eyen hadde he as an hare. A vernycle hadde he sowed upon his cappe. His walet lay biforn hym in his lappe, Bret-ful of pardoun, comen from Rome al hoot. A voys he hadde as smal as hath a goot. No berd hadde he, ne nevere sholde have, As smothe it was as it were late y-shave; I trowe he were a geldyng or a mare. But of his craft, fro Berwyk into Ware, Ne was ther swich another pardoner; For in his male he hadde a pilwe-beer, Which that, he seyde, was Oure Lady veyl; He seyde he hadde a gobet of the seyl That Seinte Peter hadde, whan that he wente Upon the see, til Jesu Crist hym hente. He hadde a croys of latoun, ful of stones, And in a glas he hadde pigges bones. But with thise relikes, whan that he fond A povre person dwellynge upon lond, Upon a day he gat hym moore moneye Than that the person gat in monthes tweye; And thus with feyned flaterye and japes He made the person and the peple his apes. But trewely to tellen atte laste, He was in chirche a noble ecclesiaste; Wel koude he rede a lessoun or a storie, But alderbest he song an offertorie; For wel he wiste, whan that song was songe, He moste preche, and wel affile his tonge To wynne silver, as he ful wel koude; Therefore he song the murierly and loude.  Now have I toold you shortly, in a clause, Thestaat, tharray, the nombre, and eek the cause Why that assembled was this compaignye In Southwerk, at this gentil hostelrye That highte the Tabard, faste by the Belle. But now is tyme to yow for to telle How that we baren us that ilke nyght, Whan we were in that hostelrie alyght; And after wol I telle of our viage And al the remenaunt of oure pilgrimage.  But first, I pray yow, of youre curteisye, That ye narette it nat my vileynye, Thogh that I pleynly speke in this mateere, To telle yow hir wordes and hir cheere, Ne thogh I speke hir wordes proprely. For this ye knowen al-so wel as I, Whoso shal telle a tale after a man, He moot reherce, as ny as evere he kan, Everich a word, if it be in his charge, Al speke he never so rudeliche and large; Or ellis he moot telle his tale untrewe, Or feyne thyng, or fynde wordes newe. He may nat spare, althogh he were his brother; He moot as wel seye o word as another. Crist spak hymself ful brode in hooly writ, And wel ye woot no vileynye is it. Eek Plato seith, whoso kan hym rede, \"The wordes moote be cosyn to the dede.\"  Also I prey yow to foryeve it me, Al have I nat set folk in hir degree Heere in this tale, as that they sholde stonde; My wit is short, ye may wel understonde.  Greet chiere made oure Hoost us everichon, And to the soper sette he us anon, And served us with vitaille at the beste: Strong was the wyn and wel to drynke us leste.  A semely man Oure Hooste was with-alle For to been a marchal in an halle. A large man he was with eyen stepe, A fairer burgeys was ther noon in Chepe; Boold of his speche, and wys, and well y-taught, And of manhod hym lakkede right naught. Eek thereto he was right a myrie man, And after soper pleyen he bigan, And spak of myrthe amonges othere thynges, Whan that we hadde maad our rekenynges; And seyde thus: \"Now, lordynges, trewely, Ye been to me right welcome, hertely; For by my trouthe, if that I shal nat lye, I saugh nat this yeer so myrie a compaignye At ones in this herberwe as is now.

Hoold up youre hond, withouten moore speche.\"  Oure conseil was nat longe for to seche; Us thoughte it was noght worth to make it wys, And graunted hym withouten moore avys, And bad him seye his verdit, as hym leste.  \"Lordynges,\" quod he, \"now herkneth for the beste; But taak it nought, I prey yow, in desdeyn; This is the poynt, to speken short and pleyn, That ech of yow, to shorte with oure weye In this viage, shal telle tales tweye, To Caunterbury-ward, I mene it so, And homward he shal tellen othere two, Of aventures that whilom han bifalle. And which of yow that bereth hym beste of alle, That is to seyn, that telleth in this caas Tales of best sentence and moost solaas, Shal have a soper at oure aller cost, Heere in this place, sittynge by this post, Whan that we come agayn fro Caunterbury. And, for to make yow the moore mury, I wol myselven gladly with yow ryde, Right at myn owene cost, and be youre gyde; And whoso wole my juggement withseye Shal paye al that we spenden by the weye. And if ye vouche-sauf that it be so, Tel me anon, withouten wordes mo, And I wol erly shape me therfore.\"  This thyng was graunted, and oure othes swore With ful glad herte, and preyden hym also That he wolde vouche-sauf for to do so, And that he wolde been oure governour, And of our tales juge and reportour, And sette a soper at a certeyn pris; And we wol reuled been at his devys In heigh and lough; and thus, by oon assent, We been acorded to his juggement. And therupon the wyn was fet anon; We dronken, and to reste wente echon, Withouten any lenger taryynge.  Amorwe, whan that day gan for to sprynge, Up roos oure Hoost and was oure aller cok, And gadrede us togidre alle in a flok; And forth we riden, a litel moore than paas, Unto the wateryng of Seint Thomas; And there oure Hoost bigan his hors areste, And seyde, \"Lordynges, herkneth, if yow leste: Ye woot youre foreward and I it yow recorde. If even-song and morwe-song accorde, Lat se now who shal telle the firste tale. As ever mote I drynke wyn or ale, Whoso be rebel to my juggement Shal paye for all that by the wey is spent. Now draweth cut, er that we ferrer twynne; He which that hath the shorteste shal bigynne. Sire Knyght,\" quod he, \"my mayster and my lord Now draweth cut, for that is myn accord.

Ley hond to, every man.\"  Anon to drawen every wight bigan, And, shortly for to tellen as it was, Were it by aventure, or sort, or cas, The sothe is this, the cut fil to the Knyght, Of which ful blithe and glad was every wyght; And telle he moste his tale, as was resoun, By foreward and by composicioun, As ye han herd; what nedeth wordes mo? And whan this goode man saugh that it was so, As he that wys was and obedient To kepe his foreward by his free assent, He seyde, \"Syn I shal bigynne the game, What, welcome be the cut, a Goddes name! Now lat us ryde, and herkneth what I seye.\" And with that word we ryden forth oure weye; And he bigan with right a myrie cheere His tale anon, and seyde in this manere.",

Shake hands for ever, cancel all our vows, And when we meet at any time again, Be it not seen in either of our brows That we one jot of former love retain. Now at the last gasp of Love's latest breath, When, his pulse failing, Passion speechless lies; When Faith is kneeling by his bed of death, And Innocence is closing up his eyes-- Now, if thou wouldst, when all have given him over, From death to life thou might'st him yet recover!",

The fire he stole, although of heavenly kind, Which from above he craftily did take, Of liveless clods, us living men to make, He did bestow in temper of the mind. But you broke into heaven's immortal store, Where virtue, honor, wit, and beauty lay; Which taking thence you have escaped away, Yet stand as free as ere you did before;    Yet old Prometheus punished for his rape.    Thus poor thieves suffer when the greater 'scape."

'When I from hence away am past     I shall not find a bride, And you shall be the first and last     I ever lay beside.'  She heard and went and knew not why;     Her heart to his she laid; Light was the air beneath the sky     But dark under the shade.  'Oh do you breathe, lad, that your breast     Seems not to rise and fall, And here upon my bosom prest     There beats no heart at all?'  'Oh loud, my girl, it once would knock,     You should have felt it then; But since for you I stopped the clock     It never goes again.'  'Oh lad, what is it, lad, that drips     Wet from your neck on mine? What is it falling on my lips,     My lad, that tastes of brine?'

Agued once like me were they, But I like them shall win my way Lastly to the bed of mould Where there's neither heat nor cold.  But from my grave across my brow Plays no wind of healing now, And fire and ice within me fight Beneath the suffocating night.",

In the nation that is not       Nothing stands that stood before; There revenges are forgot,       And the hater hates no more;  Lovers lying two and two       Ask not whom they sleep beside, And the bridegroom all night through       Never turns him to the bride."

        "Paradise Lost: Book  2 (1674 version)": "HIgh on a Throne of Royal State, which far Outshon the wealth of Ormus and of Ind, Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand Showrs on her Kings Barbaric Pearl and Gold, Satan exalted sat, by merit rais'd To that bad eminence; and from despair Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue Vain Warr with Heav'n, and by success untaught His proud imaginations thus displaid.  Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav'n, For since no deep within her gulf can hold Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall'n, I give not Heav'n for lost.   From this descent Celestial vertues rising, will appear More glorious and more dread then from no fall, And trust themselves to fear no second fate: Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav'n Did first create your Leader, next free choice, With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight, Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss Thus farr at least recover'd, hath much more Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne Yielded with full consent.   The happier state In Heav'n, which follows dignity, might draw Envy from each inferior; but who here Will envy whom the highest place exposes Formost to stand against the Thunderers aim Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share Of endless pain? where there is then no good For which to strive, no strife can grow up there From Faction; for none sure will claim in Hell Precedence, none, whose portion is so small Of present pain, that with ambitious mind Will covet more.   With this advantage then To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord, More then can be in Heav'n, we now return To claim our just inheritance of old, Surer to prosper then prosperity Could have assur'd us; and by what best way, Whether of open Warr or covert guile, We now debate; who can advise, may speak.  He ceas'd, and next him Moloc, Scepter'd King Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit That fought in Heav'n; now fiercer by despair: His trust was with th' Eternal to be deem'd Equal in strength, and rather then be less Car'd not to be at all; with that care lost Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse He reck'd not, and these words thereafter spake.  My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles, More unexpert, I boast not: them let those Contrive who need, or when they need, not now. For while they sit contriving, shall the rest, Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here Heav'ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame, The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns By our delay? no, let us rather choose Arm'd with Hell flames and fury all at once O're Heav'ns high Towrs to force resistless way, Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see Black fire and horror shot with equal rage Among his Angels; and his Throne it self Mixt with Tartarean Sulphur, and strange fire, His own invented Torments.   But perhaps The way seems difficult and steep to scale With upright wing against a higher foe. Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench Of that forgetful Lake benumm not still, That in our proper motion we ascend Up to our native seat: descent and fall To us is adverse.   Who but felt of late When the fierce Foe hung on our brok'n Rear Insulting, and pursu'd us through the Deep, With what compulsion and laborious flight We sunk thus low?   Th' ascent is easie then; Th' event is fear'd; should we again provoke Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find To our destruction: if there be in Hell Fear to be worse destroy'd: what can be worse Then to dwell here, driv'n out from bliss, condemn'd In this abhorred deep to utter woe; Where pain of unextinguishable fire Must exercise us without hope of end The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge Inexorably, and the torturing hour Calls us to Penance?   More destroy'd then thus We should be quite abolisht and expire. What fear we then? what doubt we to incense His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag'd, Will either quite consume us, and reduce To nothing this essential, happier farr Then miserable to have eternal being: Or if our substance be indeed Divine, And cannot cease to be, we are at worst On this side nothing; and by proof we feel Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav'n, And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme, Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne: Which if not Victory is yet Revenge.  He ended frowning, and his look denounc'd Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous To less then Gods.   On th' other side up rose Belial, in act more graceful and humane; A fairer person lost not Heav'n; he seemd For dignity compos'd and high exploit: But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear The better reason, to perplex and dash Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low; To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the ear, And with perswasive accent thus began.  I should be much for open Warr, O Peers, As not behind in hate; if what was urg'd Main reason to perswade immediate Warr, Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast Ominous conjecture on the whole success: When he who most excels in fact of Arms, In what he counsels and in what excels Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair And utter dissolution, as the scope Of all his aim, after some dire revenge. First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav'n are fill'd With Armed watch, that render all access Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night, Scorning surprize.   Or could we break our way By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise With blackest Insurrection, to confound Heav'ns purest Light, yet our great Enemy All incorruptible would on his Throne Sit unpolluted, and th' Ethereal mould Incapable of stain would soon expel Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire Victorious.   Thus repuls'd, our final hope Is flat despair: we must exasperate Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage, And that must end us, that must be our cure, To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, Though full of pain, this intellectual being, Those thoughts that wander through Eternity, To perish rather, swallowd up and lost In the wide womb of uncreated night, Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, Let this be good, whether our angry Foe Can give it, or will ever? how he can Is doubtful; that he never will is sure. Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, Belike through impotence, or unaware, To give his Enemies thir wish, and end Them in his anger, whom his anger saves To punish endless? wherefore cease we then? Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed, Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal woe; Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, What can we suffer worse? is this then worst, Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms? What when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and besought The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem'd A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was worse. What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage And plunge us in the flames? or from above Should intermitted vengeance arm again His red right hand to plague us? what if all Her stores were open'd, and this Firmament Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall One day upon our heads; while we perhaps Designing or exhorting glorious warr, Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl'd Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains; There to converse with everlasting groans, Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike My voice disswades; for what can force or guile With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth All these our motions vain, sees and derides; Not more Almighty to resist our might Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. Shall we then live thus vile, the Race of Heav'n Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here Chains and these Torments? better these then worse By my advice; since fate inevitable Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree, The Victors will.   To suffer, as to doe, Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd, If we were wise, against so great a foe Contending, and so doubtful what might fall. I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear What yet they know must follow, to endure Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, Our Supream Foe in time may much remit His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd Not mind us not offending, satisfi'd With what is punish't; whence these raging fires Will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames. Our purer essence then will overcome Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel, Or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd In temper and in nature, will receive Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; This horror will grow milde, this darkness light, Besides what hope the never-ending flight Of future dayes may bring, what chance, what change Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, If we procure not to our selves more woe.  Thus Belial with words cloath'd in reasons garb Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, Not peace: and after him thus Mammon spake.  Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n We warr, if warr be best, or to regain Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then May hope when everlasting Fathe shall yeild To fickle Chance and Chaos judge the strife: The former vain to hope argues as vain The latter: for what place can be for us Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord supream We overpower?   Suppose he should relent And publish Grace to all, on promise made Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we Stand in his presence humble, and receive Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne With warbl'd Hymns, and to his God head sing Forc't Halleluia's; while he Lordly sits Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers, Our servile offerings.   This must be our task In Heav'n this our delight; how wearisom Eternity so spent in worship paid To whom we hate.   Let us not then pursue By force impossible, by leave obtain'd Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our state Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek Our own good from our selves, and from our own Live to our selves, though in this vast recess, Free, and to none accountable, preferring Hard liberty before the easie yoke Of servile Pomp.   Our greatness will appeer Then most conspicuous, when great things of small, Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse We can create, and in what place so e're Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain Through labour and indurance.   This deep world Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling Sire Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd, And with the Majesty of darkness round Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles Hell? As he our darkness, cannot we his Light Imitate when we please? This Desart soile Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold; Nor want we skill or Art, from whence to raise Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew more? Our torments also may in length of time Become our Elements, these piercing Fires As soft as now severe, our temper chang'd Into their temper; which must needs remove The sensible of pain.   All things invite To peaceful Counsels, and the settl'd State Of order, how in safety best we may Compose our present evils, with regard Of what we are and were, dismissing quite All thoughts of warr: ye have what I advise.  He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain The sound of blustring winds, which all night long Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay After the Tempest:   Such applause was heard As Mammon ended, and his Sentence pleas'd, Advising peace: for such another Field They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear Of Thunder and the Sword of Michael Wrought still within them; and no less desire To found this nether Empire, which might rise By pollicy, and long process of time, In emulation opposite to Heav'n. Which when Beelzebub perceiv'd, then whom, Satan except, none higher sat, with grave Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven Deliberation sat and public care; And Princely counsel in his face yet shon, Majestic though in ruin: sage he stood With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look Drew audience and attention still as Night Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.  Thrones and Imperial Powers, off-spring of heav'n Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now Must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote Inclines, here to continue, and build up here A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream, And know not that the King of Heav'n hath doom'd This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt From Heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new League Banded against his Throne, but to remaine In strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd, Under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd His captive multitude: For he, be sure In heighth or depth, still first and last will Reign Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part By our revolt, but over Hell extend His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav'n. What sit we then projecting peace and Warr? Warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none Voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n To us enslav'd, but custody severe, And stripes, and arbitrary punishment Inflicted? and what peace can we return, But to our power hostility and hate, Untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow, Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce In doing what we most in suffering feel? Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need With dangerous expedition to invade Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege, Or ambush from the Deep.   What if we find Some easier enterprize? There is a place (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav'n Err not) another World, the happy seat Of some new Race call'd Man, about this time To be created like to us, though less In power and excellence, but favour'd more Of him who rules above; so was his will Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath, That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd. Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn What creatures there inhabit, of what mould, Or substance, how endu'd, and what thir Power, And where thir weakness, how attempted best, By force or suttlety: Though Heav'n be shut, And Heav'ns high Arbitrator sit secure In his own strength, this place may lye expos'd The utmost border of his Kingdom, left To their defence who hold it: here perhaps Som advantagious act may be achiev'd By sudden onset, either with Hell fire To waste his whole Creation, or possess All as our own, and drive as we were driven, The punie habitants, or if not drive, Seduce them to our Party, that thir God May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand Abolish his own works.   This would surpass Common revenge, and interrupt his joy In our Confusion, and our joy upraise In his disturbance; when his darling Sons HurI'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse Thir frail Original, and faded bliss, Faded so soon.   Advise if this be worth Attempting, or to sit in darkness here Hatching vain Empires. Thus Beelzebub Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis'd By Satan, and in part propos'd: for whence, But from the Author of all ill could Spring So deep a malice, to confound the race Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell To mingle and involve, done all to spite The great Creatour?   But thir spite still serves His glory to augment.   The bold design Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and joy Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.  Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate, Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are, Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate, Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms And opportune excursion we may chance Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air, To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires Shall breathe her balme.   But first whom shall we send In search of this new world, whom shall we find Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss And through the palpable obscure find out His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight Upborn with indefatigable wings Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick Of Angels watching round?   Here he had need All circumspection, and we now no less Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, The weight of all and our last hope relies.  This said, he sat; and expectation held His look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd To second, or oppose, or undertake The perilous attempt: but all sat mute, Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each In others count'nance read his own dismay Astonisht: none among the choice and prime Of those Heav'n-warring Champions could be found So hardie as to proffer or accept Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last Satan, whom now transcendent glory rais'd Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride Conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake.  O Progeny of Heav'n, Empyreal Thrones, With reason hath deep silence and demurr Seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light; Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire, Outrageous to devour, immures us round Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant Barr'd over us prohibit all egress. These past, if any pass, the void profound Of unessential Night receives him next Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being Threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf. If thence he scape into whatever world, Or unknown Region, what remains him less Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, And this Imperial Sov'ranty, adorn'd With splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd And judg'd of public moment, in the shape Of difficulty or danger could deterr Mee from attempting.   Wherefore do I assume These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign, Refusing to accept as great a share Of hazard as of honour, due alike To him who Reigns, and so much to him due Of hazard more, as he above the rest High honourd sits? Go therfore mighty Powers, Terror of Heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home, While here shall be our home, what best may ease The present misery, and render Hell More tollerable; if there be cure or charm To respite or deceive, or slack the pain Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad Through all the Coasts of dark destruction seek Deliverance for us all: this enterprize None shall partake with me.   Thus saying rose The Monarch, and prevented all reply, Prudent, least from his resolution rais'd Others among the chief might offer now (Certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard; And so refus'd might in opinion stand His Rivals, winning cheap the high repute Which he through hazard huge must earn.   But they Dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice Forbidding; and at once with him they rose; Thir rising all at once was as the sound Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend With awful reverence prone; and as a God Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav'n: Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd, That for the general safety he despis'd His own: for neither do the Spirits damn'd Loose all thir virtue; least bad men should boast Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, Or clos ambition varnisht o're with zeal. Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief: As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o'respread Heav'ns chearful face, the lowring Element Scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip Snow, or showre; If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet Extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive, The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. O shame to men!   Devil with Devil damn'd Firm concord holds, men onely disagree Of Creatures rational, though under hope Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace, Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife Among themselves, and levie cruel warres, Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy: As if (which might induce us to accord) Man had not hellish foes anow besides, That day and night for his destruction waite.  The Stygian Counsel thus dissolv'd; and forth In order came the grand infernal Peers, Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor less Than Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream, And God-like imitated State; him round A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos'd With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms. Then of thir Session ended they bid cry With Trumpets regal sound the great result: Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow Abyss Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell With deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim. Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers Disband, and wandring, each his several way Pursues, as inclination or sad choice Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain The irksom hours, till this great Chief return. Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime Upon the wing, or in swift Race contend, As at th' Olympian Games or Pythian fields; Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form. As when to warn proud Cities warr appears Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies rush To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van Prick forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir Spears Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms From either end of Heav'n the welkin burns. Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. As when Alcides from Oechalia Crown'd With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines, And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw Into th' Euboic Sea.   Others more milde, Retreated in a silent valley, sing With notes Angelical to many a Harp Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. Thir Song was partial, but the harmony (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment The thronging audience.   In discourse more sweet (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,) Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd, In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will and Fate, Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledg absolute, And found no end, in wandring mazes lost. Of good and evil much they argu'd then, Of happiness and final misery, Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame, Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm Pain for a while or anguish, and excite Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest With stubborn patience as with triple steel. Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands, On bold adventure to discover wide That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps Might yield them easier habitation, bend Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams; Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate, Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; Cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud Heard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. Farr off from these a slow and silent stream, Lethe the River of Oblivion roules Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks, Forthwith his former state and being forgets, Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. Beyond this flood a frozen Continent Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old, Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of Fire. Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail'd, At certain revolutions all the damn'd Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine Immovable, infixt, and frozen round, Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. They ferry over this Lethean Sound Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, All in one moment, and so neer the brink; But Fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards The Ford, and of it self the water flies All taste of living wight, as once it fled The lip of Tantalus.   Thus roving on In confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous Bands With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast View'd first thir lamentable lot, and found No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile They pass'd, and many a Region dolorous, O're many a Frozen, many a fierie Alpe, Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death, A Universe of death, which God by curse Created evil, for evil only good, Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds, Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, Abominable, inutterable, and worse Than Fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd, Gorgons and Hydra's, and Chimera's dire.  Mean while the Adversary of God and Man, Satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest design, Puts on swift wings, and towards the Gates of Hell Explores his solitary flight; som times He scours the right hand coast, som times the left, Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares Up to the fiery Concave touring high. As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri'd Hangs in the Clouds, by Aequinoctial Winds Close sailing from Bengala, or the Iles Of Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants bring Thir spicie Drugs: they on the Trading Flood Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole.   So seem'd Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass, Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock, Impenetrable, impal'd with circling fire, Yet unconsum'd.   Before the Gates there sat On either side a formidable shape; The one seem'd Woman to the waste, and fair, But ended foul in many a scaly fould Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm'd With mortal sting: about her middle round A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark'd With wide Cerberian mouths full loud, and rung A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep, If aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb, And kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd, Within unseen.   Farr less abhorrd than these Vex'd Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts Calabria from the hoarce Trinacrian shore: Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call'd In secret, riding through the Air she comes Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance With Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon Eclipses at thir charms.   The other shape, If shape it might be call'd that shape had none Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd, For each seem'd either; black it stood as Night, Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem'd his head The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on. Satan was now at hand, and from his seat The Monster moving onward came as fast With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode. Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd, Admir'd, not fear'd; God and his Son except, Created thing naught valu'd he nor shun'd; And with disdainful look thus first began.  Whence and what art thou, execrable shape, That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance Thy miscreated Front athwart my way To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass, That be assur'd, without leave askt of thee: Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav'n.  To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply'd, Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee, Who first broke peace in Heav'n and Faith, till then Unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious Arms Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Sons Conjur'd against the highest, for which both Thou And they outcast from God, are here condemn'd To waste Eternal dayes in woe and pain? And reck'n'st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav'n, Hell-doom'd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more, Thy King and Lord?   Back to thy punishment, False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before.  So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, So speaking and so threatning, grew tenfold More dreadful and deform: on th' other side Incenst with indignation Satan stood Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet burn'd, That fires the length of Ophiucus huge In th' Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair Shakes Pestilence and Warr.   Each at the Head Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands No second stroke intend, and such a frown Each cast at th' other, as when two black Clouds With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on Over the Caspian, then stand front to front Hov'ring a space, till Winds the signal blow To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air: So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; For never but once more was either like To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds Had been achiev'd, whereof all Hell had rung, Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key, Ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between.  O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd, Against thy only Son?   What fury O Son, Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart Against thy Fathers head? and know'st for whom; For him who sits above and laughs the while At thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute What e're his wrath, which he calls justice, bids, His wrath which one day will destroy ye both.  She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest Forbore, then these to her Satan return'd:  So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange Thou interposest, that my sudden hand Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds What it intends; till first I know of thee, What thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why In this infernal Vaile first met thou call'st Me Father, and that Fantasm ca11'st my Son? I know thee not, nor ever saw till now Sight more detestable then him and thee.  T' whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply'd; Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem Now in thine eyes so foul, once deemd so fair In Heav'n, when at th' Assembly, and in sight Of all the Seraphim with thee combin'd In bold conspiracy against Heav'ns King, All on a sudden miserable pain Surpris'd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast Threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide, Likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright, Then shining heav'nly fair, a Goddess arm'd Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis'd All th' Host of Heav'n; back they recoild affraid At first, and call'd me Sin, and for a Sign Portentous held me; but familiar grown, I pleas'd, and with attractive graces won The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing Becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st With me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd A growing burden.   Mean while Warr arose, And fields were fought in Heav'n; wherein remaind (For what could else) to our Almighty Foe Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout Through all the Empyrean: down they fell Driv'n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down Into this Deep, and in the general fall I also; at which time this powerful Key Into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass Without my op'ning.   Pensive here I sat Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. At last this odious offspring whom thou seest Thine own begotten, breaking violent way Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew Transform'd: but he my inbred enemie Forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal Dart Made to destroy: I fled, and cry'd out Death; Hell trembl'd at the hideous Name, and sigh'd From all her Caves, and back resounded Death. I fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems, Inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far, Mee overtook his mother all dismaid, And in embraces forcible and foule Ingendring with me, of that rape begot These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd And hourly born, with sorrow infinite To me, for when they list into the womb That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw My Bowels, thir repast; then bursting forth A fresh with conscious terrours vex me round, That rest or intermission none I find. Before mine eyes in opposition sits Grim Death my Son and foe, who sets them on, And me his Parent would full soon devour For want of other prey, but that he knows His end with mine involvd; and knows that I Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane, When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc'd. But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope To be invulnerable in those bright Arms, Though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint, Save he who reigns above, none can resist.  She finish'd, and the suttle Fiend his lore Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. Dear Daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy Sire, And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge Of dalliance had with thee in Heav'n, and joys Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know I come no enemie, but to set free From out this dark and dismal house of pain, Both him and thee, and all the heav'nly Host Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd Fell with us from on high: from them I go This uncouth errand sole, and one for all My self expose, with lonely steps to tread Th' unfounded deep, and through the void immense To search with wandring quest a place foretold Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now Created vast and round, a place of bliss In the Pourlieues of Heav'n, and therein plac't A race of upstart Creatures, to supply Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd, Least Heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught Then this more secret now design'd, I haste To know, and this once known, shall soon return, And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm'd With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. He ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear His famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe Destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire.  The key of this infernal Pit by due, And by command of Heav'ns all-powerful King I keep, by him forbidden to unlock These Adamantine Gates; against all force Death ready stands to interpose his dart, Fearless to be o'rmatcht by living might. But what ow I to his commands above Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down Into this gloom of Tartarus profound, To sit in hateful Office here confin'd, Inhabitant of Heav'n, and heav'nlie-born, Here in perpetual agonie and pain, With terrors and with clamors compasst round Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou My being gav'st me; whom should I obey But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon To that new world of light and bliss, among The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems Thy daughter and thy darling, without end.  Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key, Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train, Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew, Which but her self not all the Stygian powers Could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns Th' intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease Unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie With impetuous recoile and jarring sound Th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges grate Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook Of Erebus.   She op'nd, but to shut Excel'd her power; the Gates wide op'n stood, That with extended wings a Bannerd Host Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array; So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. Before thir eyes in sudden view appear The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark Illimitable Ocean without bound, Without dimension, where length, breadth, & highth, And time and place are lost; where eldest Night And Chaos.   Ancestors of Nature, hold Eternal Anarchie, amidst the noise Of endless Warrs, and by confusion stand. For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag Of each his Faction, in thir several Clanns, Light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, Swarm populous, unnumber'd as the Sands Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil, Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise Thir lighter wings.   To whom these most adhere, Hee rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits, And by decision more imbroiles the fray By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter Chance governs all.   Into this wilde Abyss, The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave, Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire, But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt Confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight, Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain His dark materials to create more Worlds, Into this wild Abyss the warie fiend Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while, Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith He had to cross.   Nor was his eare less peal'd With noises loud and ruinous (to compare Great things with small) then when Bellona storms, With all her battering Engines bent to rase Som Capital City; or less then if this frame Of Heav'n were falling, and these Elements In mutinie had from her Axle torn The stedfast Earth.   At last his Sail-broad Vannes He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets A vast vacuitie: all unawares Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour Down had been falling, had not by ill chance The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him As many miles aloft: that furie stay'd, Quencht in a Boggie Syrtis, neither Sea, Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares, Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile. As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale, Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stelth Had from his wakeful custody purloind The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, With head, hands, wings or feet pursues his way, And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: At length a universal hubbub wilde Of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, Undaunted to meet there what ever power Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne Of Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron'd Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things, The Consort of his Reign; and by them stood Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name Of Demogorgon; Rumor next and Chance, And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild, And Discord with a thousand various mouths.  T' whom Satan turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss, Chaos and ancient Night, I come no Spy, With purpose to explore or to disturb The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint Wandring this darksome Desart, as my way, Lies through your spacious Empire up to light, Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds Confine with Heav'n; or if som other place From your Dominion won, th' Ethereal King Possesses lately, thither to arrive I travel this profound, direct my course; Directed no mean recompence it brings To your behoof, if I that Region lost, All usurpation thence expell'd, reduce To her original darkness and your sway (Which is my present journey) and once more Erect the Standard there of ancient Night; Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge.  Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old With faultring speech and visage incompos'd Answer'd. I know thee, stranger, who thou art, That mighty leading Angel, who of late Made head against Heav'ns King, though overthrown. I saw and heard, for such a numerous Host Fled not in silence through the frighted deep With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, Confusion worse confounded; and Heav'n Gates Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands Pursuing.   I upon my Frontieres here Keep residence; if all I can will serve, That little which is left so to defend, Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World Hung ore my Realm, link'd in a golden Chain To that side Heav'n from whence your Legions fell: If that way be your walk, you have not farr; So much the neerer danger; go and speed; Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain.  He ceas'd; and Satan staid not to reply, But glad that now his Sea should find a shore, With fresh alacritie and force renew'd Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock Of fighting Elements, on all sides round Environ'd wins his way; harder beset And more endanger'd, then when Argo pass'd Through Bosporus betwixt the justling Rocks: Or when Ulysses on the Larbord shunnd Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steard. So he with difficulty and labour hard Mov'd on, with difficulty and labour hee; But hee once past, soon after when man fell, Strange alteration!   Sin and Death amain Following his track, such was the will of Heav'n, Pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf Tamely endur'd a Bridge of wondrous length From Hell continu'd reaching th' utmost Orbe Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse With easie intercourse pass to and fro To tempt or punish mortals, except whom God and good Angels guard by special grace. But now at last the sacred influence Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav'n Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins Her fardest verge, and Chaos to retire As from her outmost works a brok'd foe With tumult less and with less hostile din, That Satan with less toil, and now with ease Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn; Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air, Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold Farr off th' Empyreal Heav'n, extended wide In circuit, undetermind square or round, With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn'd Of living Saphire, once his native Seat; And fast by hanging in a golden Chain This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon. Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge, Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.",
        "Paradise Lost: Book  3 (1674 version)": "HAil holy Light, ofspring of Heav'n first-born, Or of th' Eternal Coeternal beam May I express thee unblam'd? since God is light, And never but in unapproached light Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee, Bright effluence of bright essence increate. Or hear'st thou rather pure Ethereal stream, Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun, Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest The rising world of waters dark and deep, Won from the void and formless infinite. Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing, Escap't the Stygian Pool, though long detain'd In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight Through utter and through middle darkness borne With other notes then to th' Orphean Lyre I sung of Chaos and Eternal Night, Taught by the heav'nly Muse to venture down The dark descent, and up to reascend, Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe, And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou Revisit'st not these eyes, that rowle in vain To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn; So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs, Or dim suffusion veild.   Yet not the more Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill, Smit with the love of sacred Song; but chief Thee Sion and the flowrie Brooks beneath That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow, Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget Those other two equal'd with me in Fate, So were I equal'd with them in renown, Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides, And Tiresias and Phineus Prophets old. Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid Tunes her nocturnal Note.   Thus with the Year Seasons return, but not to me returns Day, or the sweet approach of Ev'n or Morn, Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose, Or flocks, or heards, or human face divine; But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark Surrounds me, from the chearful wayes of men Cut off, and for the Book of knowledg fair Presented with a Universal blanc Of Natures works to mee expung'd and ras'd, And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out. So much the rather thou Celestial light Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell Of things invisible to mortal sight.  Now had the Almighty Father from above, From the pure Empyrean where he sits High Thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye, His own works and their works at once to view: About him all the Sanctities of Heaven Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv'd Beatitude past utterance; on his right The radiant image of his Glory sat, His onely Son; On Earth he first beheld Our two first Parents, yet the onely two Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac't, Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love, Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love In blissful solitude; he then survey'd Hell and the Gulf between, and Satan there Coasting the wall of Heav'n on this side Night In the dun Air sublime, and ready now To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet On the bare outside of this World, that seem'd Firm land imbosom'd without Firmament, Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air. Him God beholding from his prospect high, Wherein past, present, future he beholds, Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake.  Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds Prescrib'd, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems On desparate reveng, that shall redound Upon his own rebellious head.   And now Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way Not farr off Heav'n, in the Precincts of light, Directly towards the new created World, And Man there plac't, with purpose to assay If him by force he can destroy, or worse, By some false guile pervert; and shall pervert For man will hark'n to his glozing lyes, And easily transgress the sole Command, Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall, Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault? Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee All he could have; I made him just and right, Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. Such I created all th' Ethereal Powers And Spirits, both them who stood and them who faild; Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love, Where onely what they needs must do, appeard, Not what they would? what praise could they receive? What pleasure I from such obedience paid, When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice) Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild, Made passive both, had servd necessitie, Not mee.   They therefore as to right belongd, So were created, nor can justly accuse Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate, As if predestination over-rul'd Thir will, dispos'd by absolute Decree Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew, Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault, Which had no less prov'd certain unforeknown. So without least impulse or shadow of Fate, Or aught by me immutablie foreseen, They trespass, Authors to themselves in all Both what they judge and what they choose; for so I formd them free, and free they must remain, Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain'd Thir freedom, they themselves ordain'd thir fall. The first sort by thir own suggestion fell, Self-tempted, self-deprav'd: Man falls deceiv'd By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace, The other none: in Mercy and Justice both, Through Heav'n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel, But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine.  Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd All Heav'n, and in the blessed Spirits elect Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd: Beyond compare the Son of God was seen Most glorious, in him all his Father shon Substantially express'd, and in his face Divine compassion visibly appeerd, Love without end, and without measure Grace, Which uttering thus he to his Father spake.  O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace; For which both Heav'n and Earth shall high extoll Thy praises, with th' innumerable sound Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne Encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest. For should Man finally be lost, should Man Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest Son Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd With his own folly? that be from thee farr, That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judg Of all things made, and judgest onely right. Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught, Or proud return though to his heavier doom, Yet with revenge accomplish't and to Hell Draw after him the whole Race of mankind, By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self Abolish thy Creation, and unmake, For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made? So should thy goodness and thy greatness both Be questiond and blaspheam'd without defence.  To whom the great Creatour thus reply'd. O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight, Son of my bosom, Son who art alone My word, my wisdom, and effectual might, All hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are, all As my Eternal purpose hath decreed: Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will, Yet not of will in him, but grace in me Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall'd By sin to foul exorbitant desires; Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand On even ground against his mortal foe, By me upheld, that he may know how frail His fall'n condition is, and to me ow All his deliv'rance, and to none but me. Some I have chosen of peculiar grace Elect above the rest; so is my will: The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes Th' incensed Deitie, while offerd grace Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark, What may sufflce, and soft'n stonie hearts To pray, repent, and bring obedience due. To Prayer, repentance, and obedience due, Though but endevord with sincere intent, Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. And I will place within them as a guide My Umpire Conscience, whom if they will hear, Light after light well us'd they shall attain, And to the end persisting, safe arrive. This my long sufferance and my day of grace They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste; But hard be hard'nd, blind be blinded more, That they may stumble on, and deeper fall; And none but such from mercy I exclude. But yet all is not don; Man disobeying, Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns Against the high Supremacie of Heav'n, Affecting God-head, and so loosing all, To expiate his Treason hath naught left, But to destruction sacred and devote, He with his whole posteritie must dye, Dye hee or Justice must; unless for him Som other able, and as willing, pay The rigid satisfaction, death for death. Say Heav'nly powers, where shall we find such love, Which of ye will be mortal to redeem Mans mortal crime, and just th' unjust to save, Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare?  He ask'd, but all the Heav'nly Quire stood mute, And silence was in Heav'n: on mans behalf Patron or Intercessor none appeerd, Much less that durst upon his own head draw The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. And now without redemption all mankind Must have bin lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell By doom severe, had not the Son of God, In whom the fulness dwels of love divine, His dearest mediation thus renewd.  Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace; And shall grace not find means, that finds her way, The speediest of thy winged messengers, To visit all thy creatures, and to all Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought, Happie for man, so coming; he her aide Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost; Attonement for himself or offering meet, Indebted and undon, hath none to bring: Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life I offer, on mee let thine anger fall; Account mee man; I for his sake will leave Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee Freely put off, and for him lastly dye Well pleas'd, on me let Death wreck all his rage; Under his gloomie power I shall not long Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess Life in my self for ever, by thee I live, Though now to Death I yield, and am his due All that of me can die, yet that debt paid, Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule For ever with corruption there to dwell; But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue My vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile; Death his deaths wound shall then receive, and stoop Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm'd. I through the ample Air in Triumph high Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show The powers of darkness bound.   Thou at the sight Pleas'd, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile, While by thee rais'd I ruin all my Foes, Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave: Then with the multitude of my redeemd Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne, Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud Of anger shall remain, but peace assur'd, And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire.  His words here ended, but his meek aspect Silent yet spake, and breath'd immortal love To mortal men, above which only shon Filial obedience: as a sacrifice Glad to be offer'd, he attends the will Of his great Father.   Admiration seis'd All Heav'n, what this might mean, and whither tend Wondring; but soon th' Almighty thus reply'd:  O thou in Heav'n and Earth the only peace Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou My sole complacence! well thou know'st how dear, To me are all my works, nor Man the least Though last created, that for him I spare Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save, By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost. Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem, Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyn; And be thy self Man among men on Earth, Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed, By wondrous birth: Be thou in Adams room The Head of all mankind, though Adams Son. As in him perish all men, so in thee As from a second root shall be restor'd, As many as are restor'd, without thee none. His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit Imputed shall absolve them who renounce Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, And live in thee transplanted, and from thee Receive new life.   So Man, as is most just, Shall satisfie for Man, be judg'd and die, And dying rise, and rising with him raise His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life. So Heav'nly love shall outdoo Hellish hate Giving to death, and dying to redeeme, So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate So easily destroy'd, and still destroyes In those who, when they may, accept not grace. Nor shalt thou by descending to assume Mans Nature, less'n or degrade thine owne. Because thou hast, though Thron'd in highest bliss Equal to God, and equally enjoying God-like fruition, quitted all to save A World from utter loss, and hast been found By Merit more then Birthright Son of God, Found worthiest to be so by being Good, Farr more then Great or High; because in thee Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds, Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne; Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reign Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man, Anointed universal King, all Power I give thee, reign for ever, and assume Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce: All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell; When thou attended gloriously from Heav'n Shalt in the Sky appeer, and from thee send The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes The living, and forthwith the cited dead Of all past Ages to the general Doom Shall hast'n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep. Then all thy Saints assembl'd, thou shalt judge Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full, Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.   Mean while The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring New Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell, And after all thir tribulations long See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth. Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by, For regal Scepter then no more shall need, God shall be All in All.   But all ye Gods, Adore him, who to compass all this dies, Adore the Son, and honour him as mee.  No sooner had th' Almighty ceas't, but all The multitude of Angels with a shout Loud as from numbers without number, sweet As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav'n rung With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna's filld Th' eternal Regions: lowly reverent Towards either Throne they bow, and to the ground With solemn adoration down they cast Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold, Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence To Heav'n remov'd where first it grew, there grows, And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life, And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn Rowls o're Elisian Flours her Amber stream; With these that never fade the Spirits elect Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath'd with beams, Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon Impurpl'd with Celestial Roses smil'd. Then Crown'd again thir gold'n Harps they took, Harps ever tun'd, that glittering by thir side Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet Of charming symphonie they introduce Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high; No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine Melodious part, such concord is in Heav'n.  Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent, Immutable, Immortal, Infinite, Eternal King; thee Author of all being, Fountain of Light, thy self invisible Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st Thron'd inaccessible, but when thou shad'st The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine, Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer, Yet dazle Heav'n, that brightest Seraphim Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes. Thee next they sang of all Creation first, Begotten Son, Divine Similitude, In whose conspicuous count'nance, without cloud Made visible, th' Almighty Father shines, Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides, Transfus'd on thee his ample Spirit rests. Hee Heav'n of Heavens and all the Powers therein By thee created, and by thee threw down Th' aspiring Dominations: thou that day Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare, Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook Heav'ns everlasting Frame, while o're the necks Thou drov'st of warring Angels disarraid. Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime Thee only extoll'd, Son of thy Fathers might, To execute fierce vengeance on his foes, Not so on Man; him through their malice fall'n, Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome So strictly, but much more to pitie encline: No sooner did thy dear and onely Son Perceive thee purpos'd not to doom frail Man So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin'd, He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife Of Mercy and justice in thy face discern'd, Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat Second to thee, offerd himself to die For mans offence.   O unexampl'd love, Love no where to be found less then Divine! Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name Shall be the copious matter of my Song Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine.  Thus they in Heav'n, above the starry Sphear, Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent. Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe Of this round World, whose first convex divides The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos'd From Chaos and th' inroad of Darkness old, Satan alighted walks: a Globe farr off It seem'd, now seems a boundless Continent Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night Starless expos'd, and ever-threatning storms Of Chaos blustring round, inclement skie; Save on that side which from the wall of Heav'n Though distant farr som small reflection gaines Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud: Here walk'd the Fiend at large in spacious field. As when a Vultur on Imaus bred, Whose snowie ridge the roving Tartar bounds, Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; But in his way lights on the barren Plaines Of Sericana, where Chineses drive With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light: So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend Walk'd up and down alone bent on his prey, Alone, for other Creature in this place Living or liveless to be found was none, None yet, but store hereafter from the earth Up hither like Aereal vapours flew Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin With vanity had filld the works of men: Both all things vain, and all who in vain things Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame, Or happiness in this or th' other life; All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal, Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds; All th, unaccomplisht works of Natures hand, Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt, Dissolvd on Earth, fleet hither, and in vain, Till final dissolution, wander here, Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd; Those argent Fields more likely habitants, Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold Betwixt th' Angelical and Human kinde: Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born First from the ancient World those Giants came With many a vain exploit, though then renownd: The builders next of Babel on the Plain Of Sennaar, and still with vain designe New Babels, had they wherewithall, would build: Others came single; he who to be deemd A God, leap'd fondly into Aetna flames, Empedocles, and hee who to enjoy Plato's Elysium, leap'd into the Sea, Cleombrotus, and many more too long, Embryo's and Idiots, Eremits and Friers White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie. Here Pilgrims roam, that stray'd so farr to seek In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heav'n; And they who to be sure of Paradise Dying put on the weeds of Dominic, Or in Franciscan think to pass disguis'd; They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt, And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov'd; And now Saint Peter at Heav'ns Wicket seems To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot Of Heav'ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe A violent cross wind from either Coast Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry Into the devious Air; then might ye see Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads, Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls, The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft Fly o're the backside of the World farr off Into a Limbo large and broad, since calld The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown Long after, now unpeopl'd, and untrod; All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass'd, And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste His travell'd steps; farr distant he descries Ascending by degrees magnificent Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high, At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn. The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw Angels ascending and descending, bands Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled To Padan-Aram in the field of Luz, Dreaming by night under the open Skie, And waking cri'd, This is the Gate of Heav'n. Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood There alwayes, but drawn up to Heav'n somtimes Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow'd Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv'd, Wafted by Angels, or flew o're the Lake Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds. The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss. Direct against which op'nd from beneath, Just o're the blissful seat of Paradise, A passage down to th' Earth, a passage wide, Wider by farr then that of after-times Over Mount Sion, and, though that were large, Over the Promis'd Land to God so dear, By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes, On high behests his Angels to and fro Pass'd frequent, and his eye with choice regard From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood To Beersaba, where the Holy Land Borders on Aegypt and the Arabian shoare; So wide the op'ning seemd, where bounds were set To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave. Satan from hence now on the lower stair That scal'd by steps of Gold to Heav'n Gate Looks down with wonder at the sudden view Of all this World at once.   As when a Scout Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone All night; at last by break of chearful dawne Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill, Which to his eye discovers unaware The goodly prospect of some forein land First-seen, or some renown'd Metropolis With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd, Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams. Such wonder seis'd, though after Heaven seen, The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis'd At sight of all this World beheld so faire. Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood So high above the circling Canopie Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point Of Libra to the fleecie Starr that bears Andromeda farr off Atlantic Seas Beyond th' Horizon; then from Pole to Pole He views in bredth, and without longer pause Down right into the Worlds first Region throws His flight precipitant, and windes with ease Through the pure marble Air his oblique way Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds, Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles, Like those Hesperian Gardens fam'd of old, Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales, Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there He stayd not to enquire: above them all The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven Allur'd his eye: Thither his course he bends Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe By center, or eccentric, hard to tell, Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick, That from his Lordly eye keep distance due, Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute Days, months, & years, towards his all-chearing Lamp Turn swift thir various motions, or are turnd By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms The Univers, and to each inward part With gentle penetration, though unseen, Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep: So wondrously was set his Station bright. There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps Astronomer in the Sun's lucent Orbe Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never saw. The place he found beyond expression bright, Compar'd with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone; Not all parts like, but all alike informd With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire; If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer; If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite, Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon In Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone besides Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen, That stone, or like to that which here below Philosophers in vain so long have sought, In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde Volatil Hermes, and call up unbound In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea, Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme. What wonder then if fields and regions here Breathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers run Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch Th' Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt Here in the dark so many precious things Of colour glorious and effect so rare? Here matter new to gaze the Devil met Undazl'd, farr and wide his eye commands, For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon Culminate from th' Aequator, as they now Shot upward still direct, whence no way round Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire, No where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual ray To objects distant farr, whereby he soon Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand, The same whom John saw also in the Sun: His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid; Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar Circl'd his Head, nor less his Locks behind Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy'd He seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep. Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope To find who might direct his wandring flight To Paradise the happie seat of Man, His journies end and our beginning woe. But first he casts to change his proper shape, Which else might work him danger or delay: And now a stripling Cherube he appeers, Not of the prime, yet such as in his face Youth smil'd Celestial, and to every Limb Sutable grace diffus'd, so well he feignd; Under a Coronet his flowing haire In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore Of many a colourd plume sprinkl'd with Gold, His habit fit for speed succinct, and held Before his decent steps a Silver wand. He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright, Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd, Admonisht by his ear, and strait was known Th' Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seav'n Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes That run through all the Heav'ns, or down to th' Earth Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, O're Sea and Land: him Satan thus accostes;  Uriel, for thou of those seav'n Spirits that stand In sight of God's high Throne, gloriously bright, The first art wont his great authentic will Interpreter through highest Heav'n to bring, Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend; And here art likeliest by supream decree Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye To visit oft this new Creation round; Unspeakable desire to see, and know All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man, His chief delight and favour, him for whom All these his works so wondrous he ordaind, Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim Alone thus wandring.   Brightest Seraph tell In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell; That I may find him, and with secret gaze, Or open admiration him behold On whom the great Creator hath bestowd Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd; That both in him and all things, as is meet, The Universal Maker we may praise; Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss Created this new happie Race of Men To serve him better: wise are all his wayes.  So spake the false dissembler unperceivd; For neither Man nor Angel can discern Hypocrisie, the onely evil that walks Invisible, except to God alone, By his permissive will, through Heav'n and Earth: And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil'd Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and held The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav'n; Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule In his uprightness answer thus returnd. Fair Angel, thy desire which tends to know The works of God, thereby to glorifie The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess That reaches blame, but rather merits praise The more it seems excess, that led thee hither From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone, To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps Contented with report hear onely in heav'n: For wonderful indeed are all his works, Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all Had in remembrance alwayes with delight; But what created mind can comprehend Thir number, or the wisdom infinite That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. I saw when at his Word the formless Mass, This worlds material mould, came to a heap: Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar Stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd; Till at his second bidding darkness fled, Light shon, and order from disorder sprung: Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire, And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav'n Flew upward, spirited with various forms, That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; Each had his place appointed, each his course, The rest in circuit walles this Universe. Look downward on that Globe whose hither side With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light His day, which else as th' other Hemisphere Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon (So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide Timely interposes, and her monthly round Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav'n; With borrowd light her countenance triform Hence fills and empties to enlighten th' Earth, And in her pale dominion checks the night. That spot to which I point is Paradise, Adams abode, those loftie shades his Bowre. Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.  Thus said, he turnd, and Satan bowing low, As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven, Where honour due and reverence none neglects, Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath, Down from th' Ecliptic, sped with hop'd success, Throws his steep flight in many an Aerie wheele, Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.",
        "Paradise Lost: Book  4 (1674 version)": "O For that warning voice, which he who saw Th' Apocalyps, heard cry in Heaven aloud, Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, Came furious down to be reveng'd on men, Wo to the inhabitants on Earth! that now, While time was, our first-Parents had bin warnd The coming of thir secret foe, and scap'd Haply so scap'd his mortal snare; for now Satan, now first inflam'd with rage, came down, The Tempter ere th' Accuser of man-kind, To wreck on innocent frail man his loss Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell: Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold, Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest, And like a devillish Engine back recoiles Upon himself; horror and doubt distract His troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr The Hell within him, for within him Hell He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell One step no more then from himself can fly By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie Of what he was, what is, and what must be Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad, Sometimes towards Heav'n and the full-blazing Sun, Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre: Then much revolving, thus in sighs began.  O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd, Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the God Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call, But with no friendly voice, and add thy name O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams That bring to my remembrance from what state I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare; Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down Warring in Heav'n against Heav'ns matchless King: Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return From me, whom he created what I was In that bright eminence, and with his good Upbraided none; nor was his service hard. What could be less then to afford him praise, The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, How due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me, And wrought but malice; lifted up so high I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher Would set me highest, and in a moment quit The debt immense of endless gratitude, So burthensome still paying, still to ow; Forgetful what from him I still receivd, And understood not that a grateful mind By owing owes not, but still pays, at once Indebted and dischargd; what burden then? O had his powerful Destiny ordaind Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais'd Ambition.   Yet why not? som other Power As great might have aspir'd, and me though mean Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great Fell not, but stand unshak'n, from within Or from without, to all temptations arm'd. Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand? Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, But Heav'ns free Love dealt equally to all? Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate, To me alike, it deals eternal woe. Nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will Chose freely what it now so justly rues. Me miserable! which way shall I flie Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire? Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell; And in the lowest deep a lower deep Still threatning to devour me opens wide, To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav'n. O then at last relent: is there no place Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left? None left but by submission; and that word Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc'd With other promises and other vaunts Then to submit, boasting I could subdue Th' Omnipotent.   Ay me, they little know How dearly I abide that boast so vaine, Under what torments inwardly I groane; While they adore me on the Throne of Hell, With Diadem and Scepter high advanc'd The lower still I fall, onely Supream In miserie; such joy Ambition findes. But say I could repent and could obtaine By Act of Grace my former state; how soon Would higth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay What feign'd submission swore: ease would recant Vows made in pain, as violent and void. For never can true reconcilement grow Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc'd so deep: Which would but lead me to a worse relapse And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare Short intermission bought with double smart. This knows my punisher; therefore as farr From granting hee, as I from begging peace: All hope excluded thus, behold in stead Of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight, Mankind created, and for him this World. So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear, Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost; Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least Divided Empire with Heav'ns King I hold By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne; As Man ere long, and this new World shall know.  Thus while he spake, each passion dimm'd his face Thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envie and despair, Which marrd his borrow'd visage, and betraid Him counterfet, if any eye beheld. For heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule Are ever cleer.   Whereof hee soon aware, Each perturbation smooth'd with outward calme, Artificer of fraud; and was the first That practisd falshood under saintly shew, Deep malice to conceale, couch't with revenge: Yet not anough had practisd to deceive Uriel once warnd; whose eye pursu'd him down The way he went, and on th' Assyrian mount Saw him disfigur'd, more then could befall Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce He markd and mad demeanour, then alone, As he suppos'd, all unobserv'd, unseen. So on he fares, and to the border comes, Of Eden, where delicious Paradise, Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green, As with a rural mound the champain head Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde, Access deni'd; and over head up grew Insuperable highth of loftiest shade, Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm, A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre Of stateliest view.   Yet higher then thir tops The verdurous wall of paradise up sprung: Which to our general Sire gave prospect large Into his neather Empire neighbouring round. And higher then that Wall a circling row Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit, Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt: On which the Sun more glad impress'd his beams Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow, When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires Vernal delight and joy, able to drive All sadness but despair: now gentle gales Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole Those balmie spoiles.   As when to them who saile Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past Mozambic, off at Sea North-East windes blow Sabean Odours from the spicie shoare Of Arabie the blest, with such delay Well pleas'd they slack thir course, and many a League Chear'd with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles. So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas'd Then Asmodeus with the fishie fume, That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse Of Tobits Son, and with a vengeance sent From Media post to Aegypt, there fast bound.  Now to th' ascent of that steep savage Hill Satan had journied on, pensive and slow; But further way found none, so thick entwin'd, As one continu'd brake, the undergrowth Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext All path of Man or Beast that past that way: One Gate there only was, and that look'd East On th' other side: which when th' arch-fellon saw Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt, At one slight bound high over leap'd all bound Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within Lights on his feet.   As when a prowling Wolfe, Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve In hurdl'd Cotes amid the field secure, Leaps o're the fence with ease into the Fould:. Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores, Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault, In at the window climbs, or o're the tiles; So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould: So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe. Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life, The middle Tree and highest there that grew, Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death To them who liv'd; nor on the vertue thought Of that life-giving Plant, but only us'd For prospect, what well us'd had bin the pledge Of immortality.   So little knows Any, but God alone, to value right The good before him, but perverts best things To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use. Beneath him with new wonder now he views To all delight of human sense expos'd In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more, A Heav'n on Earth, for blissful Paradise Of God the Garden was, by him in the East Of Eden planted; Eden stretchd her Line From Auran Eastward to the Royal Towrs Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian Kings, Or where the Sons of Eden long before Dwelt in Telassar: in this pleasant soile His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind; Out of the fertil ground he caus'd to grow All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; And all amid them stood the Tree of Life, High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life Our Death the Tree of knowledge grew fast by, Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill. Southward through Eden went a River large, Nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggie hill Pass'd underneath ingulft, for God had thrown That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais'd Upon the rapid current, which through veins Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn, Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill Waterd the Garden; thence united fell Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood, Which from his darksom passage now appeers, And now divided into four main Streams, Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme And Country whereof here needs no account, But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks, Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold, With mazie error under pendant shades Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine, Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote The open field, and where the unpierc't shade lmbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place, A happy rural seat of various view; Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme, Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde Hung amiable, Hesperian Fables true, If true, here only, and of delicious taste: Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks Grasing the tender herb, were interpos'd, Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap Of som irriguous Valley spred her store, Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose: Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves Of coole recess, o're which the mantling vine Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake, That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd, Her chrystal mirror holds, unite thir streams. The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires, Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune The trembling leaves, while Universal Pan Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance Led on th' Eternal Spring.   Not that faire field Of Enna, where Proserpin gathering flours Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie Dis Was gatherd, which cost Ceres all that pain To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove Of Daphne by Orontes, and th' inspir'd Castalian Spring, might with this Paradise Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian Ile Girt with the River Triton, where old Cham, Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Lybian Jove, Hid Amalthea and her Florid Son Young Bacchus from his Stepdame Rhea's eye; Nor where Abassin Kings thir issue Guard, Mount Amara, though this by som suppos'd True Paradise under the Ethiop Line By Nilus head, enclosd with shining Rock, A whole days journy high, but wide remote From this Assyrian Garden, where the Fiend Saw undelighted all delight, all kind Of living Creatures new to sight and strange: Two of far nobler shape erect and tall, Godlike erect, with native Honour clad In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all, And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine The image of thir glorious Maker shon, Truth, wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure, Severe but in true filial freedom plac't; Whence true autoritie in men; though both Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd; For contemplation hee and valour formd, For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace, Hee for God only, shee for God in him: His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar'd Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks Round from his parted forelock manly hung Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad: Shee as a vail down to the slender waste Her unadorned golden tresses wore Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav'd As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli'd Subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway, And by her yielded, by him best receivd, Yielded with coy submission, modest pride, And sweet reluctant amorous delay. Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald, Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame Of natures works, honor dishonorable, Sin-bred, how have ye troubl'd all mankind With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure, And banisht from mans life his happiest life, Simplicitie and spotless innocence. So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill: So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair That ever since in loves imbraces met, Adam the goodliest man of men since borne His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters Eve. Under a tuft of shade that on a green Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side They sat them down, and after no more toil Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic'd To recommend coole Zephyr, and made ease More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell, Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours: The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream; Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League, Alone as they.   About them frisking playd All Beasts of th' Earth, since wilde, and of all chase In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den; Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw Dandl'd the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards, Gambold before them, th' unwieldy Elephant To make them mirth us'd all his might, and wreathd His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine His breaded train, and of his fatal guile Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat, Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun Declin'd was hasting now with prone carreer To th' Ocean Iles, and in th' ascending Scale Of Heav'n the Starrs that usher Evening rose: When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood, Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad.  O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold, Into our room of bliss thus high advanc't Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, Not Spirits, yet to heav'nly Spirits bright Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue With wonder, and could love, so lively shines In them Divine resemblance, and such grace The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd. Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh Your change approaches, when all these delights Will vanish and deliver ye to woe, More woe, the more your taste is now of joy; Happie, but for so happie ill secur'd Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav'n Ill fenc't for Heav'n to keep out such a foe As now is enterd; yet no purpos'd foe To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne Though I unpittied: League with you I seek, And mutual amitie so streight, so close, That I with you must dwell, or you with me Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such Accept your Makers work; he gave it me, Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfold, To entertain you two, her widest Gates, And send forth all her Kings; there will be room, Not like these narrow limits, to receive ass Your numerous ofspring; if no better place, Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd. And should I at your harmless innocence Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just, Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg'd, By conquering this new World, compels me now To do what else though damnd I should abhorre.  So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie, The Tyrants plea, excus'd his devilish deeds. Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree Down he alights among the sportful Herd Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one, Now other, as thir shape servd best his end Neerer to view his prey, and unespi'd To mark what of thir state he more might learn By word or action markt: about them round A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare, Then as a Tyger, who by chance hath spi'd In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play, Strait couches close, then rising changes oft His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground Whence rushing he might surest seize them both Grip't in each paw: When Adam first of men To first of women Eve thus moving speech, Turnd him all eare to hear new utterance flow.  Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes, Dearer thy self then all; needs must the power That made us, and for us this ample World Be infinitly good, and of his good As liberal and free as infinite, That rais'd us from the dust and plac't us here In all this happiness, who at his hand Have nothing merited, nor can performe Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires From us no other service then to keep This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees In Paradise that bear delicious fruit So various, not to taste that onely Tree Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life, So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is, Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst God hath pronounc't it death to taste that Tree, The only sign of our obedience left Among so many signes of power and rule Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv'n Over all other Creatures that possess Earth, Aire, and Sea.   Then let us not think hard One easie prohibition, who enjoy Free leave so large to all things else, and choice Unlimited of manifold delights: But let us ever praise him, and extoll His bountie, following our delightful task To prune these growing Plants, and tend these Flours, Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet.  To whom thus Eve repli'd.   O thou for whom And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh, And without whom am to no end, my Guide And Head, what thou hast said is just and right. For wee to him indeed all praises owe, And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee Praeeminent by so much odds, while thou Like consort to thy self canst no where find. That day I oft remember, when from sleep I first awak't, and found my self repos'd Under a shade of flours, much wondring where And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound Of waters issu'd from a Cave and spread Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov'd Pure as th' expanse of Heav'n; I thither went With unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe On the green bank, to look into the cleer Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie. As I bent down to look, just opposite, A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd Bending to look on me, I started back, It started back, but pleas'd I soon returnd, Pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks Of sympathie and love; there I had fixt Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire, Had not a voice thus warnd me,   What thou seest, What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self, With thee it came and goes: but follow me, And I will bring thee where no shadow staies Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call'd Mother of human Race: what could I doe, But follow strait, invisibly thus led? Till I espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall, Under a Platan, yet methought less faire, Less winning soft, less amiablie milde, Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd, Thou following cryd'st aloud, Return faire Eve, Whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art, His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart Substantial Life, to have thee by my side Henceforth an individual solace dear; Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim My other half: with that thy gentle hand Seisd mine, I yielded, and from that time see How beauty is excelld by manly grace And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.  So spake our general Mother, and with eyes Of conjugal attraction unreprov'd, And meek surrender, half imbracing leand On our first Father, half her swelling Breast Naked met his under the flowing Gold Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms Smil'd with superior Love, as Jupiter On Juno smiles, when he impregns the Clouds That shed May Flowers; and press'd her Matron lip With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne Ey'd them askance, and to himself thus plaind.  Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two Imparadis't in one anothers arms The happier Eden, shall enjoy thir fill Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust, Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, Among our other torments not the least, Still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines; Yet let me not forget what I have gain'd From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems: One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call'd, Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd'n? Suspicious, reasonless.   Why should thir Lord Envie them that? can it be sin to know, Can it be death? and do they onely stand By Ignorance, is that thir happie state, The proof of thir obedience and thir faith? O fair foundation laid whereon to build Thir ruine! Hence I will excite thir minds With more desire to know, and to reject Envious commands, invented with designe To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such, They taste and die: what likelier can ensue? But first with narrow search I must walk round This Garden, and no corner leave unspi'd; A chance but chance may lead where I may meet Some wandring Spirit of Heav'n, by Fountain side, Or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw What further would be learnt.   Live while ye may, Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return, Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed.  So saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd, But with sly circumspection, and began Through wood, through waste, o're hill, o're dale his roam. Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav'n With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun Slowly descended, and with right aspect Against the eastern Gate of Paradise Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock Of Alablaster, pil'd up to the Clouds, Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent Accessible from Earth, one entrance high; The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung Still as it rose, impossible to climbe. Betwixt these rockie Pillars Gabriel sat Chief of th' Angelic Guards, awaiting night; About him exercis'd Heroic Games Th' unarmed Youth of Heav'n, but nigh at hand Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares, Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold. Thither came Uriel, gliding through the Eeven On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr In Autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fir'd Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner From what point of his Compass to beware Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste.  Gabriel, to thee thy course by Lot hath giv'n Charge and strict watch that to this happie Place No evil thing approach or enter in; This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare A Spirit, zealous, as he seem'd, to know More of th' Almighties works, and chiefly Man Gods latest Image: I describ'd his way Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate; But in the Mount that lies from Eden North, Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks Alien from Heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd: Mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew I fear, hath ventur'd from the deep, to raise New troubles; him thy care must be to find.  To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd: Uriel, no wonder if thy perfet sight, Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst, See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass The vigilance here plac't, but such as come Well known from Heav'n; and since Meridian hour No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort, So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude Spiritual substance with corporeal barr. But if within the circuit of these walks, In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom Thou tellst, by morrow dawning I shall know.  So promis'd hee, and Uriel to his charge Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall'n Beneath th' Azores; whither the prime Orb, Incredible how swift, had thither rowl'd Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth By shorter flight to th' East, had left him there Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend: Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray Had in her sober Liverie all things clad; Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird, They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale; She all night long her amorous descant sung; Silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the Firmament With living Saphirs: Hesperus that led The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon Rising in clouded Majestie, at length Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light, And o're the dark her Silver Mantle threw.  When Adam thus to Eve: Fair Consort, th' hour Of night, and all things now retir'd to rest Mind us of like repose, since God hath set Labour and rest, as day and night to men Successive, and the timely dew of sleep Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest; Man hath his daily work of body or mind Appointed, which declares his Dignitie, And the regard of Heav'n on all his waies; While other Animals unactive range, And of thir doings God takes no account. To morrow ere fresh Morning streak the East With first approach of light, we must be ris'n, And at our pleasant labour, to reform Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green, Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown, That mock our scant manuring, and require More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth: Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms, That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth, Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest.  To whom thus Eve with perfet beauty adornd. My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst Unargu'd I obey; so God ordains, God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise. With thee conversing I forget all time, All seasons and thir change, all please alike. Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun When first on this delightful Land he spreads His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour, Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth After soft showers; and sweet the coming on Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon, And these the Gemms of Heav'n, her starrie train: But neither breath of Morn when she ascends With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure, Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers, Nor grateful Eevning mild, nor silent Night With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon, Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet. But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?  To whom our general Ancestor repli'd. Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht Eve, Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth, By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land In order, though to Nations yet unborn, Ministring light prepar'd, they set and rise; Least total darkness should by Night regaine Her old possession, and extinguish life In Nature and all things, which these soft fires Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate Of various influence foment and warme, Temper or nourish, or in part shed down Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow On Earth, made hereby apter to receive Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray. These then, though unbeheld in deep of night, Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none, That heav'n would want spectators, God want praise; Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:. All these with ceasless praise his works behold Both day and night: how often from the steep Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard Celestial voices to the midnight air, Sole, or responsive each to others note Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk With Heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds In full harmonic number joind, thir songs Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.  Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place Chos'n by the sovran Planter, when he fram'd All things to mans delightful use; the roofe Of thickest covert was inwoven shade Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side Acanthus, and each odorous bushie shrub Fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour, Iris all hues, Roses, and Gessamin Rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought Mosaic; underfoot the Violet, Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay Broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none; Such was thir awe of Man.   In shadie Bower More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd, Pan or Silvanus never slept, nor Nymph, Nor Faunus haunted.   Here in close recess With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs Espoused Eve deckt first her nuptial Bed, And heav'nly Quires the Hymenaean sung, What day the genial Angel to our Sire Brought her in naked beauty more adorn'd, More lovely then Pandora, whom the Gods Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like In sad event, when to the unwiser Son Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnar'd Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng'd On him who had stole Joves authentic fire.  Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv'd, both stood Both turnd, and under op'n Skie ador'd The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth and Heav'n Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe And starrie Pole: Thou also mad'st the Night, Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day, Which we in our appointed work imployd Have finisht happie in our mutual help And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss Ordaind by thee, and this delicious place For us too large, where thy abundance wants Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. But thou hast promis'd from us two a Race To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.  This said unanimous, and other Rites Observing none, but adoration pure Which God likes best, into thir inmost bowre Handed they went; and eas'd the putting off These troublesom disguises which wee wear, Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene Adam from his fair Spouse, nor Eve the Rites Mysterious of connubial Love refus'd: Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk Of puritie and place and innocence, Defaming as impure what God declares Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all. Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain But our destroyer, foe to God and Man? Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source Of human ofspring, sole proprietie, In Paradise of all things common else. By thee adulterous lust was driv'n from men Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee Founded in Reason, Loyal, just, and Pure, Relations dear, and all the Charities Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known. Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame, Or think thee unbefitting holiest place, Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets, Whose bed is undefil'd and chaste pronounc't, Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us'd. Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings, Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard, Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal, Or Serenate, which the starv'd Lover sings To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept, And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair'd.   Sleep on Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek No happier state, and know to know no more.  Now had night measur'd with her shaddowie Cone Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault, And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim Forth issuing at th' accustomd hour stood armd To thir night watches in warlike Parade, When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake.  Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the South With strictest watch; these other wheel the North, Our circuit meets full West. As flame they part Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear. From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. Ithuriel and Zephon, with wingd speed Search through this Garden, leave unsearcht no nook, But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge, Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme. This Eevning from the Sun's decline arriv'd Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap'd The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt: Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.  So saying, on he led his radiant Files, Daz'ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct In search of whom they sought: him there they found Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of Eve; Assaying by his Devilish art to reach The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams, Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint Th' animal Spirits that from pure blood arise Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise At least distemperd, discontented thoughts, Vaine hopes, vaine aimes, inordinate desires Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride. Him thus intent Ithuriel with his Spear Touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure Touch of Celestial temper, but returns Of force to its own likeness: up he starts Discoverd and surpriz'd.   As when a spark Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine With sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the Aire: So started up in his own shape the Fiend. Back stept those two faire Angels half amaz'd So sudden to behold the grieslie King; Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon.  Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg'd to Hell Com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd, Why satst thou like an enemie in waite Here watching at the head of these that sleep?  Know ye not then said Satan, fill'd with scorn, Know ye not mee? ye knew me once no mate For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare; Not to know mee argues your selves unknown, The lowest of your throng; or if ye know, Why ask ye, and superfluous begin Your message, like to end as much in vain? To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn. Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, Or undiminisht brightness, to be known As when thou stoodst in Heav'n upright and pure; That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good, Departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule. But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep This place inviolable, and these from harm.  So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke Severe in youthful beautie, added grace Invincible: abasht the Devil stood, And felt how awful goodness is, and saw Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd His loss; but chiefly to find here observd His lustre visibly impar'd; yet seemd Undaunted.   If I must contend, said he, Best with the best, the Sender not the sent, Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn, Or less be lost.   Thy fear, said Zephon bold, Will save us trial what the least can doe Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.  The Fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage; But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on, Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie He held it vain; awe from above had quelld His heart, not else dismai'd.   Now drew they nigh The western Point, where those half-rounding guard just met, and closing stood in squadron joind Awaiting next command.   To whom thir Chief Gabriel from the Front thus calld aloud.  O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade, And with them comes a third of Regal port, But faded splendor wan; who by his gate And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, Not likely to part hence without contest; Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.  He scarce had ended, when those two approachd And brief related whom they brought, where found, How busied, in what form and posture coucht. To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake.  Why hast thou, Satan broke the bounds prescrib'd To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge Of others, who approve not to transgress By thy example, but have power and right To question thy bold entrance on this place; Imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss?  To whom thus Satan, with contemptuous brow. Gabriel, thou hadst in Heav'n th' esteem of wise, And such I held thee; but this question askt Puts me in doubt.   Lives ther who loves his pain? Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, Though thither doomd? Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt, And boldly venture to whatever place Farthest from pain, where thou mightest hope to change Torment with ease, and soonest recompence Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; To thee no reason; who knowst only good, But evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object His will who bound us? let him surer barr His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay In that dark durance: thus much what was askt. The rest is true, they found me where they say; But that implies not violence or harme.  Thus he in scorn.The warlike Angel mov'd, Disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd. O loss of one in Heav'n to judge of wise, Since Satan fell, whom follie overthrew, And now returns him from his prison scap't, Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither Unlicenc't from his bounds in Hell prescrib'd; So wise he judges it to fly from pain However, and to scape his punishment. So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, Which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain Can equal anger infinite provok't. But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief, The first in flight from pain, had'st thou alledg'd To thy deserted host this cause of flight, Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.  To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern. Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide Thy blasting volied Thunder made all speed And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear. But still thy words at random, as before, Argue thy inexperience what behooves From hard assaies and ill successes past A faithful Leader, not to hazard all Through wayes of danger by himself untri'd. I therefore, I alone first undertook To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie This new created World, whereof in Hell Fame is not silent, here in hope to find Better abode, and my afflicted Powers To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire; Though for possession put to try once more What thou and thy gay Legions dare against; Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord High up in Heav'n, with songs to hymne his Throne, And practis'd distances to cringe, not fight.  To whom the warriour Angel, soon repli'd. To say and strait unsay, pretending first Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie, Argues no Leader but a lyar trac't, Satan, and couldst thou faithful add? O name, O sacred name of faithfulness profan'd! Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head; Was this your discipline and faith ingag'd, Your military obedience, to dissolve Allegeance to th' acknowldg'd Power supream? And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem Patron of liberty, who more then thou Once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd Heav'ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne? But mark what I arreede thee now, avant; Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre Within these hallowd limits thou appeer, Back to th' infernal pit I drag thee chaind, And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd.  So threatn'd hee, but Satan to no threats Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli'd.  Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines, Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers, Us'd to the yoak, draw'st his triumphant wheels In progress through the rode of Heav'n Star-pav'd.  While thus he spake, th' Angelic Squadron bright Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round With ported Spears, as thick as when a field Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves Prove chaff. On th' other side Satan allarm'd Collecting all his might dilated stood, Like Teneriff or Atlas unremov'd: His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest Sat horror Plum'd; nor wanted in his graspe What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds Might have ensu'd, nor onely Paradise In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope Of Heav'n perhaps, or all the Elements At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne With violence of this conflict, had not soon Th' Eternal to prevent such horrid fray Hung forth in Heav'n his golden Scales, yet seen Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion signe, Wherein all things created first he weighd, The pendulous round Earth with ballanc't Aire In counterpoise, now ponders all events, Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights The sequel each of parting and of fight; The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam; Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend.  Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine, Neither our own but giv'n; what follie then To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more Then Heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now To trample thee as mire: for proof look up, And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign Where thou art weigh'd, and shown how light, how weak, If thou resist. The Fiend lookt up and knew His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.",
        "Paradise Lost: Book  5 (1674 version)": "NOw Morn her rosie steps in th' Eastern ClimeAdvancing, sow'd the earth with Orient Pearle,When Adam wak't, so customd, for his sleepWas Aerie light from pure digestion bred,And temperat vapors bland, which th' only soundOf leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan,Lightly dispers'd, and the shrill Matin SongOf Birds on every bough; so much the moreHis wonder was to find unwak'nd EveWith Tresses discompos'd, and glowing Cheek,As through unquiet rest: he on his sideLeaning half-rais'd, with looks of cordial LoveHung over her enamour'd, and beheldBeautie, which whether waking or asleep,Shot forth peculiar Graces; then with voiceMilde, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus.   AwakeMy fairest, my espous'd, my latest found,Heav'ns last best gift, my ever new delight,Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh fieldCalls us, we lose the prime, to mark how springOur tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove,What drops the Myrrhe, and what the balmie Reed,How Nature paints her colours, how the BeeSits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.Such whispering wak'd her, but with startl'd eyeOn Adam, whom imbracing, thus she spake.O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I seeThy face, and Morn return'd, for I this Night,Such night till this I never pass'd, have dream'd,If dream'd, not as I oft am wont, of thee,Works of day pass't, or morrows next designe,But of offence and trouble, which my mindKnew never till this irksom night;   methoughtClose at mine ear one call'd me forth to walkWith gentle voice, I though it thine; it said,Why sleepst thou Eve?   now is the pleasant time,The cool, the silent, save where silence yieldsTo the night-warbling Bird, that now awakeTunes sweetest his love-labor'd song; now reignesFull Orb'd the Moon, and with more pleasing lightShadowie sets off the face of things; in vain,If none regard; Heav'n wakes with all his eyes,Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire,In whose sight all things joy, with ravishmentAttracted by thy beauty still to gaze.I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;To find thee I directed then my walk;And on, methought, alone I pass'd through waysThat brought me on a sudden to the TreeOf interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem'd,Much fairer to my Fancie then by day:And as I wondring lookt, beside it stoodOne shap'd and wing'd like one of those from Heav'nBy us oft seen; his dewie locks distill'dAmbrosia; on that Tree he also gaz'd;And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg'd,Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet,Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis'd?Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste?Forbid who will, none shall from me withholdLonger thy offerd good, why else set here?This said he paus'd not, but with ventrous ArmeHe pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil'dAt such bold words voucht with a deed so bold:But he thus overjoy'd, O Fruit Divine,Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt,Forbidd'n here, it seems, as onely fitFor God's, yet able to make Gods of Men:And why not Gods of Men, since good, the moreCommunicated, more abundant growes,The Author not impair'd, but honourd more?Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic Eve,Partake thou also; happie though thou art,Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be:Taste this, and be henceforth among the GodsThy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind,But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimesAscend to Heav'n, by merit thine, and seeWhat life the Gods live there, and such live thou.So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,Even to my mouth of that same fruit held partWhich he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smellSo quick'nd appetite, that I, methought,Could not but taste.   Forthwith up to the CloudsWith him I flew, and underneath beheldThe Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wideAnd various: wondring at my flight and changeTo this high exaltation; suddenlyMy Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down,And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak'dTo find this but a dream!   Thus Eve her NightRelated, and thus Adam answerd sad.Best image of my self and dearer half,The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleepAffects me equally; nor can I likeThis uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear;Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,Created pure.   But know that in the SouleAre many lesser Faculties that serveReason as chief; among these Fansie nextHer office holds; of all external things,Which the five watchful Senses represent,She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes,Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, framesAll what we affirm or what deny, and callOur knowledge or opinion; then retiresInto her private Cell when Nature rests,Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakesTo imitate her; but misjoyning shapes,Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams,Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.Som such resemblances methinks I findOf our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream,But with addition strange; yet be not sad.Evil into the mind of God or ManMay come or go, so unapprov'd, and leaveNo spot or blame behind: Which gives me hopeThat what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream,Waking thou never wilt consent to do.Be not disheart'nd then, nor cloud those looksThat wont to be more chearful and sereneThen when fair Morning first smiles on the World,And let us to our fresh imployments riseAmong the Groves, the Fountains, and the FloursThat open now thir choicest bosom'd smellsReservd from night, and kept for thee in store.So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,But silently a gentle tear let fallFrom either eye, and wip'd them with her haire;Two other precious drops that ready stood,Each in thir Chrystal sluce, hee ere they fellKiss'd as the gracious signs of sweet remorseAnd pious awe, that feard to have offended.So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste.But first from under shadie arborous roof,Soon as they forth were come to open sightOf day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risenWith wheels yet hov'ring o're the Ocean brim,Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray,Discovering in wide Lantskip all the EastOf Paradise and Edens happie Plains,Lowly they bow'd adoring, and beganThir Orisons, each Morning duly paidIn various style, for neither various styleNor holy rapture wanted they to praiseThir Maker, in fit strains pronounc't or sungUnmeditated, such prompt eloquenceFlowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse,More tuneable then needed Lute or HarpTo add more sweetness, and they thus began.These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,Almightie, thine this universal Frame,Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then!Unspeakable, who first above these HeavensTo us invisible or dimly seenIn these thy lowest works, yet these declareThy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine:Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light,Angels, for yee behold him, and with songsAnd choral symphonies, Day without Night,Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav'n,On Earth joyn all ye Creatures to extollHim first, him last, him midst, and without end.Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night,If better thou belong not to the dawn,Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling MornWith thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy SpheareWhile day arises, that sweet hour of Prime.Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule,Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praiseIn thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st,And when high Noon hast gaind, and when thou fallst.Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli'stWith the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies,And yee five other wandring Fires that moveIn mystic Dance not without Song, resoundHis praise, who out of Darkness call'd up Light,Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birthOf Natures Womb, that in quaternion runPerpetual Circle, multiform; and mixAnd nourish all things, let your ceasless changeVarie to our great Maker still new praise.Ye Mists and Exhalations that now riseFrom Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey,Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold,In honour to the Worlds great Author rise;Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie,Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers,Rising or falling still advance his praise.His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow,Breathe soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines,With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave.Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow,Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds,That singing up to Heaven gate ascend,Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise;Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walkThe Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven,To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shadeMade vocal by my Song, and taught his praise.Hail universal Lord, be bounteous stillTo give us onely good; and if the nightHave gathered aught of evil or conceald,Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark.So pray'd they innocent, and to thir thoughtsFirm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm.On to thir mornings rural work they hasteAmong sweet dewes and flours; where any rowOf Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farrThir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to checkFruitless imbraces: or they led the VineTo wed her Elm; she spous'd about him twinesHer mariageable arms, and with her bringsHer dowr th' adopted Clusters, to adornHis barren leaves.   Them thus imploid beheldWith pittie Heav'ns high King, and to him call'dRaphael, the sociable Spirit, that deign'dTo travel with Tobias, and secur'dHis marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid.Raphael, said hee, thou hear'st what stir on EarthSatan from Hell scap't through the darksom GulfHath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbdThis night the human pair, how he designesIn them at once to ruin all mankind.Go therefore, half this day as friend with friendConverse with Adam, in what Bowre or shadeThou find'st him from the heat of Noon retir'd,To respit his day-labour with repast,Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,As may advise him of his happie state,Happiness in his power left free to will,Left to his own free Will, his Will though free,Yet mutable; whence warne him to bewareHe swerve not too secure: tell him withallHis danger, and from whom, what enemieLate falln himself from Heav'n, is plotting nowThe fall of others from like state of bliss;By violence, no, for that shall be withstood,But by deceit and lies; this let him know,Least wilfully transgressing he pretendSurprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd.So spake th' Eternal Father, and fulfilldAll Justice: nor delaid the winged SaintAfter his charge receivd, but from amongThousand Celestial Ardors, where he stoodVaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing lightFlew through the midst of Heav'n; th' angelic QuiresOn each hand parting, to his speed gave wayThrough all th' Empyreal road; till at the GateOf Heav'n arriv'd, the gate self-opend wideOn golden Hinges turning, as by workDivine the sov'ran Architect had fram'd.From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,Starr interpos'd, however small he sees,Not unconform to the other shining Globes,Earth and the Gard'n of God, with Cedars crowndAbove all Hills.   As when by night the GlassOf Galileo, less assur'd, observesImagind Lands and Regions in the Moon:Or Pilot from amidst the CycladesDelos or Samos first appeering kennsA cloudy spot.   Down thither prone in flightHe speeds, and through the vast Ethereal SkieSailes between worlds and worlds, with steddie wingNow on the polar windes, then with quick FannWinnows the buxom Air;   till within soareOf Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seemsA Phoenix, gaz'd by all, as that sole BiradWhen to enshrine his reliques in the Sun'sBright Temple, to Aegyptian Theb's he flies.At once on th' Eastern cliff of ParadiseHe lights, and to his proper shape returnsA Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shadeHis lineaments Divine; the pair that cladEach shoulder broad, came mantling o're his brestWith regal Ornament; the middle pairGirt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and roundSkirted his loines and thighes with downie GoldAnd colours dipt in Heav'n; the third his feetShaddowd from either heele with featherd maileSkie-tinctur'd grain.   Like Maia's son he stood,And shook his Plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance filldThe circuit wide.

But goe with speed,And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poureAbundance, fit to honour and receiveOur Heav'nly stranger; well we may affordOur givers thir own gifts, and large bestowFrom large bestowd, where Nature multipliesHer fertil growth, and by disburd'ning growsMore fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.To whom thus Eve.   Adam, earths hallowd mouldOf God inspir'd, small store will serve, where store,All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;Save what by frugal storing firmness gainsTo nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:But I will haste and from each bough and break,Each Plant and juciest Gourd will pluck such choiceTo entertain our Angel guest, as heeBeholding shall confess that here on EarthGod hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav'n.So saying, with dispatchful looks in hasteShe turns, on hospitable thoughts intentWhat choice to chuse for delicacie best,What order, so contriv'd as not to mixTastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bringTaste after taste upheld with kindliest change,Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalkWhatever Earth all-bearing Mother yieldsIn India East or West, or middle shoareIn Pontus or the Punic Coast, or whereAlcinous reign'd, fruit of all kindes, in coate,Rough, or smooth rin'd, or bearded husk, or shellShe gathers, Tribute large, and on the boardHeaps with unsparing hand; for drink the GrapeShe crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathesFrom many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prestShe tempers dulcet creams, nor these to holdWants her fit vessels pure, then strews the groundWith Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum'd.Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meetHis god-like Guest, walks forth, without more trainAccompani'd then with his own compleatPerfections, in himself was all his state,More solemn then the tedious pomp that waitsOn Princes, when thir rich Retinue longOf Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with GoldDazles the croud, and sets them all agape.Neerer his presence Adam though not awd,Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,As to a superior Nature, bowing low,Thus said.

On whom the Angel HaileBestowd, the holy salutation us'dLong after to blest Marie, second Eve.Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful WombShall fill the World more numerous with thy SonsThen with these various fruits the Trees of GodHave heap'd this Table.

A while discourse they hold;No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus beganOur Authour.   Heav'nly stranger, please to tasteThese bounties which our Nourisher, from whomAll perfet good unmeasur'd out, descends,To us for food and for delight hath caus'dThe Earth to yield; unsavourie food perhapsTo spiritual Natures; only this I know,That one Celestial Father gives to all.To whom the Angel.   Therefore what he gives(Whose praise be ever sung) to man in partSpiritual, may of purest Spirits be foundNo ingrateful food; and food alike those pureIntelligential substances requireAs doth your Rational; and both containWithin them every lower facultieOf sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,And corporeal to incorporeal turn.For know, whatever was created, needsTo be sustaind and fed; of ElementsThe grosser feeds the purer, Earth the Sea,Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those FiresEthereal, and as lowest first the Moon;Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg'dVapours not yet into her substance turnd.Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhaleFrom her moist Continent to higher Orbes.The Sun that light imparts to all, receivesFrom all his alimental recompenceIn humid exhalations, and at EvenSups with the Ocean: though in Heav'n the TreesOf life ambrosial frutage bear, and vinesYield Nectar, though from off the boughs each MornWe brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the groundCover'd with pearly grain: yet God hath hereVaried his bounty so with new delights,As may compare with Heaven; and to tasteThink not I shall be nice.   So down they sat,And to thir viands fell, nor seeminglyThe Angel, nor in mist, the common glossOf Theologians, but with keen dispatchOf real hunger, and concoctive heate.To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpiresThrough Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fireOf sooty coal the Empiric AlchimistCan turn, or holds it possible to turnMetals of drossiest Ore to perfet GoldAs from the Mine.   Mean while at Table EveMinisterd naked, and thir flowing cupsWith pleasant liquors crown'd:   O innocenceDeserving Paradise! if ever, then,Then had the Sons of God excuse to have binEnamour'd at that sight; but in those heartsLove unlibidinous reign'd, nor jealousieWas understood, the injur'd Lovers Hell.Thus when with meats and drinks they had suffic'd,Not burd'nd Nature, sudden mind aroseIn Adam, not to let th' occasion passGiven him by this great Conference to knowOf things above his World, and of thir beingWho dwell in Heav'n, whose excellence he sawTranscend his own so farr, whose radiant formsDivine effulgence, whose high Power so farExceeded human, and his wary speechThus to th' Empyreal Minister he fram'd.Inhabitant with God, now know I wellThy favour, in this honour done to man,Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf'tTo enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,As that more willingly thou couldst not seemAs Heav'ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare?To whom the winged Hierarch repli'd.O Adam, one Almightie is, from whomAll things proceed, and up to him return,If not deprav'd from good, created allSuch to perfection, one first matter all,Indu'd with various forms various degreesOf substance, and in things that live, of life;But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure,As neerer to him plac't or neerer tendingEach in thir several active Sphears assignd,Till body up to spirit work, in boundsProportiond to each kind.

But say,What meant that caution joind, if ye be foundObedient? can we want obedience thenTo him, or possibly his love desertWho formd us from the dust, and plac'd us hereFull to the utmost measure of what blissHuman desires can seek or apprehend?To whom the Angel.   Son of Heav'n and Earth,Attend: That thou are happie, owe to God;That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self,That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.This was that caution giv'n thee; be advis'd.God made thee perfet, not immutable;And good he made thee, but to persevereHe left it in thy power, ordaind thy willBy nature free, not over-rul'd by FateInextricable, or strict necessity;Our voluntarie service he requires,Not our necessitated, such with himFindes no acceptance, nor can find, for howCan hearts, not free, be tri'd whether they serveWilling or no, who will but what they mustBy Destinie, and can no other choose?My self and all th' Angelic Host that standIn sight of God enthron'd, our happie stateHold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;On other surety none; freely we serve,Because wee freely love, as in our willTo love or not; in this we stand or fall:And som are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n,And so from Heav'n to deepest Hell; O fallFrom what high state of bliss into what woe!To whom our great Progenitor.   Thy wordsAttentive, and with more delighted eare,Divine instructer, I have heard, then whenCherubic Songs by night from neighbouring HillsAereal Music send: nor knew I notTo be both will and deed created free;Yet that we never shall forget to loveOur maker, and obey him whose commandSingle, is yet so just, my constant thoughtsAssur'd me, and still assure: though what thou tellstHath past in Heav'n, som doubt within me move,But more desire to hear, if thou consent,The full relation, which must needs be strange,Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard;And we have yet large day, for scarce the SunHath finisht half his journey, and scarce beginsHis other half in the great Zone of Heav'n.Thus Adam made request, and RaphaelAfter short pause assenting, thus began.High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men,Sad task and hard, for how shall I relateTo human sense th' invisible exploitsOf warring Spirits; how without remorseThe ruin of so many glorious onceAnd perfet while they stood; how last unfouldThe secrets of another world, perhapsNot lawful to reveal? yet for thy goodThis is dispenc't, and what surmounts the reachOf human sense, I shall delineate so,By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms,As may express them best, though what if EarthBe but the shaddow of Heav'n, and things thereinEach to other like, more then on earth is thought?As yet this world was not, and Chaos wildeReignd where these Heav'ns now rowl, where Earth now restsUpon her Center pois'd, when on a day(For Time, though in Eternitie, appli'dTo motion, measures all things durableBy present, past, and future) on such dayAs Heav'ns great Year brings forth, th' Empyreal HostOf Angels by Imperial summons call'd,Innumerable before th' Almighties ThroneForthwith from all the ends of Heav'n appeerdUnder thir Hierarchs in orders brightTen thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc'd,Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and ReareStreame in the Aire, and for distinction serveOf Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees;Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz'dHoly Memorials, acts of Zeale and LoveRecorded eminent.   Thus when in OrbsOf circuit inexpressible they stood,Orb within Orb, the Father infinite,By whom in bliss imbosom'd sat the Son,Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whose topBrightness had made invisible, thus spake.Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light,Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,Hear my Decree, which unrevok't shall stand.This day I have begot whom I declareMy onely Son, and on this holy HillHim have anointed, whom ye now beholdAt my right hand;   your Head I him appoint;And by my Self have sworn to him shall bowAll knees in Heav'n, and shall confess him Lord:Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abideUnited as one individual SouleFor ever happie: him who disobeyesMee disobeyes, breaks union, and that dayCast out from God and blessed vision, fallsInto utter darkness, deep ingulft, his placeOrdaind without redemption, without end.So spake th' Omnipotent, and with his wordsAll seemd well pleas'd, all seem'd, but were not all.That day, as other solemn dayes, they spentIn song and dance about the sacred Hill,Mystical dance, which yonder starrie SpheareOf Planets and of fixt in all her WheelesResembles nearest, mazes intricate,Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regularThen most, when most irregular they seem,And in thir motions harmonie DivineSo smooths her charming tones, that Gods own earListens delighted.   Eevning now approach'd(For wee have also our Eevning and our Morn,Wee ours for change delectable, not need)Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turnDesirous; all in Circles as they stood,Tables are set, and on a sudden pil'dWith Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flowsIn Pearl, in Diamond, and massie GoldFruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav'n.On flours repos'd, and with fresh flourets crownd,They eate, they drink, and in communion sweetQuaff immortalitie and joy, secureOf surfet where full measure onely boundsExcess, before th' all bounteous King, who showrdWith copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy.Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal'dFrom that high mount of God, whence light & shadeSpring both, the face of brightest Heav'n had changdTo grateful Twilight (for Night comes not thereIn darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos'dAll but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,Wide over all the Plain, and wider farrThen all this globous Earth in Plain out spred,(Such are the Courts of God) Th' Angelic throngDisperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extendBy living Streams among the Trees of Life,Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard,Celestial Tabernacles, where they sleptFannd with cool Winds, save those who in thir courseMelodious Hymns about the sovran ThroneAlternate all night long: but not so wak'dSatan, so call him now, his former nameIs heard no more in Heav'n; he of the first,If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,In favour and in praeeminence, yet fraughtWith envie against the Son of God, that dayHonourd by his great Father, and proclaimdMessiah King anointed, could not beareThrough pride that sight, & thought himself impaird.Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain,Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houreFriendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv'dWith all his Legions to dislodge, and leaveUnworshipt, unobey'd the Throne supreamContemptuous, and his next subordinateAwak'ning, thus to him in secret spake.Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can closeThy eye-lids: and remembrest what DecreeOf yesterday, so late hath past the lipsOf Heav'ns Almightie.   Thou to me thy thoughtsWast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;Both waking we were one; how then can nowThy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos'd;New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raiseIn us who serve, new Counsels, to debateWhat doubtful may ensue, more in this placeTo utter is not safe.   Assemble thouOf all those Myriads which we lead the chief;Tell them that by command, ere yet dim NightHer shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste,And all who under me thir Banners wave,Homeward with flying march where we possessThe Quarters of the North, there to prepareFit entertainment to receive our KingThe great Messiah, and his new commands,Who speedily through all the HierarchiesIntends to pass triumphant, and give Laws.So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus'dBad influence into th' unwarie brestOf his Associate; hee together calls,Or several one by one, the Regent Powers,Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught,That the most High commanding, now ere Night,Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav'n,The great Hierarchal Standard was to move;Tells the suggested cause, and cast betweenAmbiguous words and jealousies, to soundOr taint integritie; but all obey'dThe wonted signal, and superior voiceOf thir great Potentate; for great indeedHis name, and high was his degree in Heav'n;His count'nance, as the Morning Starr that guidesThe starrie flock, allur'd them, and with lyesDrew after him the third part of Heav'ns Host:Mean while th' Eternal eye, whose sight discernesAbstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy MountAnd from within the golden Lamps that burneNightly before him, saw without thir lightRebellion rising, saw in whom, how spredAmong the sons of Morn, what multitudesWere banded to oppose his high Decree;And smiling to his onely Son thus said.Son, thou in whom my glory I beholdIn full resplendence, Heir of all my might,Neerly it now concernes us to be sureOf our Omnipotence, and with what ArmsWe mean to hold what anciently we claimOf Deitie or Empire, such a foeIs rising, who intends to erect his ThroneEqual to ours, throughout the spacious North;Nor so content, hath in his thought to tryIn battel, what our Power is, or our right.Let us advise, and to this hazard drawWith speed what force is left, and all imployIn our defence, lest unawares we loseThis our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill.To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleerLight'ning Divine, ineffable, serene,Made answer.   Mightie Father, thou thy foesJustly hast in derision, and secureLaugh'st at thir vain designes and tumults vain,Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hateIllustrates, when they see all Regal PowerGiv'n me to quell thir pride, and in eventKnow whether I be dextrous to subdueThy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav'n.So spake the Son, but Satan with his PowersFar was advanc't on winged speed, an HostInnumerable as the Starrs of Night,Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the SunImpearls on every leaf and every flouer.Regions they pass'd, the mightie RegenciesOf Seraphim and Potentates and ThronesIn thir triple Degrees, Regions to whichAll thy Dominion, Adam, is no moreThen what this Garden is to all the Earth,And all the Sea, from one entire globoseStretcht into Longitude; which having pass'dAt length into the limits of the NorthThey came, and Satan to his Royal seatHigh on a Hill, far blazing, as a MountRais'd on a Mount, with Pyramids and TowrsFrom Diamond Quarries hew'n, and Rocks of Gold,The Palace of great Lucifer, (so callThat Structure in the Dialect of menInterpreted) which not long after, heAffecting all equality with God,In imitation of that Mount whereonMessiah was delar'd in sight of Heav'n,The Mountain of the Congregation call'd;For thither he assembl'd all his Train,Pretending so commanded to consultAbout the great reception of thir King,Thither to come, and with calumnious ArtOf counterfeted truth thus held thir ears.Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers,If these magnific Titles yet remainNot meerly titular, since by DecreeAnother now hath to himself ingross'tAll Power, and us eclipst under the nameOf King anointed, for whom all this hasteOf midnight march, and hurried meeting here,This onely to consult how we may bestWith what may be devis'd of honours newReceive him coming to receive from usKnee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile,Too much to one, but double how endur'd,To one and to his image now proclaim'd?But what if better counsels might erectOur minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke?Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bendThe supple knee? ye will not, if I trustTo know ye right, or if ye know your selvesNatives and Sons of Heav'n possest beforeBy none, and if not equal all, yet free,Equally free; for Orders and DegreesJarr not with liberty, but well consist.Who can in reason then or right assumeMonarchie over such as live by rightHis equals, if in power and splendor less,In freedome equal? or can introduceLaw and Edict on us, who without lawErre not, much less for this to be our Lord,And look for adoration to th' abuseOf those Imperial Titles which assertOur being ordain'd to govern, not to serve?Thus farr his bold discourse without controuleHad audience, when among the SeraphimAbdiel, then whom none with more zeale ador'dThe Deitie, and divine commands obei'd,Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severeThe current of his fury thus oppos'd.O argument blasphemous, false and proud!Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav'nExpected, least of all from thee, ingrateIn place thy self so high above thy Peeres.Canst thou with impious obloquie condemneThe just Decree of God, pronounc't and sworn,That to his only Son by right endu'dWith Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav'nShall bend the knee, and in that honour dueConfess him rightful King? unjust thou saistFlatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free,And equal over equals to let Reigne,One over all with unsucceeded power.Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou disputeWith him the points of libertie, who madeThee what thou art, and formd the Pow'rs of Heav'nSuch as he pleasd, and circumscrib'd thir being?Yet by experience taught we know how good,And of our good, and of our dignitieHow provident he is, how farr from thoughtTo make us less, bent rather to exaltOur happie state under one Head more neerUnited.   But to grant it thee unjust,That equal over equals Monarch Reigne:Thy self though great and glorious dost thou count,Or all Angelic Nature joind in one,Equal to him begotten Son, by whomAs by his Word the mighty Father madeAll things, ev'n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav'nBy him created in thir bright degrees,Crownd them with Glory, and to thir Glory nam'dThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur'd,But more illustrious made, since he the HeadOne of our number thus reduc't becomes,His Laws our Laws, all honour to him doneReturns our own.   Cease then this impious rage,And tempt not these;   but hast'n to appeaseTh' incensed Father, and th' incensed Son,While Pardon may be found in time besought.So spake the fervent Angel, but his zealeNone seconded, as out of season judg'd,Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic'dTh' Apostat, and more haughty thus repli'd.That were formd then saist thou? and the workOf secondarie hands, by task transferdFrom Father to his Son? strange point and new!Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who sawWhen this creation was? rememberst thouThy making, while the Maker gave thee being?We know no time when we were not as now;Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais'dBy our own quick'ning power, when fatal courseHad circl'd his full Orbe, the birth matureOf this our native Heav'n, Ethereal Sons.Our puissance is our own, our own right handShall teach us highest deeds, by proof to tryWho is our equal: then thou shalt beholdWhether by supplication we intendAddress, and to begirt th' Almighty ThroneBeseeching or besieging.   This report,These tidings carrie to th' anointed King;And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.He said, and as the sound of waters deepHoarce murmur echo'd to his words applauseThrough the infinite Host, nor less for thatThe flaming Seraph fearless, though aloneEncompass'd round with foes, thus answerd bold.O alienate from God, O spirit accurst,Forsak'n of all good; I see thy fallDetermind, and thy hapless crew involv'dIn this perfidious fraud, contagion spredBoth of thy crime and punishment: henceforthNot more be troubl'd how to quit the yokeOf Gods Messiah; those indulgent LawsWill not be now voutsaf't, other DecreesAgainst thee are gon forth without recall;That Golden Scepter which thou didst rejectIs now an Iron Rod to bruise and breakThy disobedience.   Well thou didst advise,Yet not for thy advise or threats I flyThese wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauthImpendent, raging into sudden flameDistinguish not: for soon expect to feelHis Thunder on thy head, devouring fire.Then who created thee lamenting learne,When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.So spake the Seraph Abdiel faithful found,Among the faithless, faithful only hee;Among innumerable false, unmov'd,Unshak'n, unseduc'd, unterrifi'dHis Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale;Nor number, nor example with him wroughtTo swerve from truth, or change his constant mindThough single.   From amidst them forth he pass'd,Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteindSuperior, nor of violence fear'd aught;And with retorted scorn his back he turn'dOn those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom'd.",
        "Paradise Lost: Book  6 (1674 version)": "ALL night the dreadless Angel unpursu'd Through Heav'ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn, Wak't by the circling Hours, with rosie hand Unbarr'd the gates of Light.   There is a Cave Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne, Where light and darkness in perpetual round Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav'n Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night; Light issues forth, and at the other dore Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre To veile the Heav'n, though darkness there might well Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn Such as in highest Heav'n, arrayd in Gold Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night, Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright, Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view: Warr he perceav'd, warr in procinct, and found Already known what he for news had thought To have reported: gladly then he mixt Among those friendly Powers who him receav'd With joy and acclamations loud, that one That of so many Myriads fall'n, yet one Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill They led him high applauded, and present Before the seat supream; from whence a voice From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard.  Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought The better fight, who single hast maintaind Against revolted multitudes the Cause Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes; And for the testimonie of Truth hast born Universal reproach, far worse to beare Then violence: for this was all thy care To stand approv'd in sight of God, though Worlds Judg'd thee perverse: the easier conquest now Remains thee, aided by this host of friends, Back on thy foes more glorious to return Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue By force, who reason for thir Law refuse, Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King Messiah, who by right of merit Reigns. Go Michael of Celestial Armies Prince, And thou in Military prowess next Gabriel, lead forth to Battel these my Sons Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints By Thousands and by Millions rang'd for fight; Equal in number to that Godless crew Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav'n Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss, Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide His fiery Chaos to receave thir fall.  So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe Of wrauth awak't: nor with less dread the loud Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow: At which command the Powers Militant, That stood for Heav'n, in mighty Quadrate joyn\"d Of Union irresistible, mov'd on In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound Of instrumental Harmonie that breath'd Heroic Ardor to advent'rous deeds Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause Of God and his Messiah.   On they move Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill, Nor streit'ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore Thir nimble tread, as when the total kind Of Birds in orderly array on wing Came summond over Eden to receive Thir names of thee; so over many a tract Of Heav'n they march'd, and many a Province wide Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last Farr in th' Horizon to the North appeer'd From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht In battailous aspect, and neerer view Bristl'd with upright beams innumerable Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng'd, and Shields Various, with boastful Argument portraid, The banded Powers of Satan hasting on With furious expedition; for they weend That self same day by fight, or by surprize To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne To set the envier of his State, the proud Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov'd fond and vain In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd At first, that Angel should with Angel warr, And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet So oft in Festivals of joy and love Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire Hymning th' Eternal Father: but the shout Of Battel now began, and rushing sound Of onset ended soon each milder thought. High in the midst exalted as a God Th' Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos'd With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields; Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now 'Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left, A dreadful intervall, and Front to Front Presented stood in terrible array Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van, On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn,d, Satan with vast and haughtie strides advanc't, Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold; Abdiel that sight endur'd not, where he stood Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, And thus his own undaunted heart explores.  O Heav'n! that such resemblance of the Highest Should yet remain, where faith and realtie Remain not; wherfore should not strength and might There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable? His puissance, trusting in th' Almightie's aide, I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri'd Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just, That he who in debate of Truth hath won, Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike Victor; though brutish that contest and foule, When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so Most reason is that Reason overcome.  So pondering, and from his armed Peers Forth stepping opposite, half way he met His daring foe, at this prevention more Incens't, and thus securely him defi'd.  Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht The highth of thy aspiring unoppos'd, The Throne of God unguarded, and his side Abandond at the terror of thy Power Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain Against th' Omnipotent to rise in Arms; Who out of smallest things could without end Have rais'd incessant Armies to defeat Thy folly; or with solitarie hand Reaching beyond all limit at one blow Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then To thee not visible, when I alone Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late How few somtimes may know, when thousands err.  Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance Thus answerd.   Ill for thee, but in wisht houre Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst From flight, seditious Angel, to receave Thy merited reward, the first assay Of this right hand provok't, since first that tongue Inspir'd with contradiction durst oppose A third part of the Gods, in Synod met Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel Vigour Divine within them, can allow Omnipotence to none.   But well thou comst Before thy fellows, ambitious to win From me som Plume, that thy success may show Destruction to the rest: this pause between (Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know; At first I thought that Libertie and Heav'n To heav'nly Soules had bin all one; but now I see that most through sloth had rather serve, Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song; Such hast thou arm'd, the Ministrelsie of Heav'n, Servilitie with freedom to contend, As both thir deeds compar'd this day shall prove.  To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern repli'd. Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find Of erring, from the path of truth remote: Unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name Of Servitude to serve whom God ordains, Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same, When he who rules is worthiest, and excells Them whom he governs.   This is servitude, To serve th' unwise, or him who hath rebelld Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee, Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall'd; Yet leudly dar'st our ministring upbraid. Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve In Heav'n God ever blest, and his Divine Behests obey, worthiest to be obey'd, Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight, This greeting on thy impious Crest receive. So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell On the proud Crest of Satan, that no sight, Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth Winds under ground or waters forcing way Sidelong, had push't a Mountain from his seat Half sunk with all his Pines.   Amazement seis'd The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see Thus foil'd thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout, Presage of Victorie and fierce desire Of Battel: whereat Michael bid sound Th' Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung Hosanna to the Highest: nor stood at gaze The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn'd The horrid shock: now storming furie rose, And clamour such as heard in Heav'n till now Was never, Arms on Armour clashing bray'd Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles Of brazen Chariots rag'd; dire was the noise Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew, And flying vaulted either Host with fire. So under fierie Cope together rush'd Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault And inextinguishable rage; all Heav'n Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth Had to her Center shook.   What wonder? when Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought On either side, the least of whom could weild These Elements, and arm him with the force Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power Armie against Armie numberless to raise Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb, Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat; Had not th' Eternal King Omnipotent From his strong hold of Heav'n high over-rul'd And limited thir might; though numberd such As each divided Legion might have seemd A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway Of Battel, open when, and when to close The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight, None of retreat, no unbecoming deed That argu'd fear; each on himself reli'd, As onely in his arm the moment lay Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground A standing fight, then soaring on main wing Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale The Battel hung; till Satan, who that day Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes No equal, raunging through the dire attack Of fighting Seraphim confus'd, at length Saw where the Sword of Michael smote, and fell'd Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand He hasted, and oppos'd the rockie Orb Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield A vast circumference:   At his approach The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile Surceas'd, and glad as hoping here to end Intestine War in Heav'n, the arch foe subdu'd Or Captive drag'd in Chains, with hostile frown And visage all enflam'd first thus began.  Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt, Unnam'd in Heav'n, now plenteous, as thou seest These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all, Though heaviest by just measure on thy self And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb d Heav'ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought Miserie, uncreated till the crime Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill'd Thy malice into thousands, once upright And faithful, now prov'd false.   But think not here To trouble Holy Rest; Heav'n casts thee out From all her Confines.   Heav'n the seat of bliss Brooks not the works of violence and Warr. Hence then, and evil go with thee along Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell, Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles, Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome, Or som more sudden vengeance wing'd from God Precipitate thee with augmented paine.  So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus The Adversarie.   Nor think thou with wind Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds Thou canst not.   Hast thou turnd the least of these To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end The strife which thou call'st evil, but wee style The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win, Or turn this Heav'n it self into the Hell Thou fablest, here however to dwell free, If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force, And join him nam'd Almighty to thy aid, I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh.  They ended parle, and both addrest for fight Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue Of Angels, can relate, or to what things Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift Human imagination to such highth Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd, Stood they or mov'd, in stature, motion, arms Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav'n. Now wav'd thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields Blaz'd opposite, while expectation stood In horror; from each hand with speed retir'd Where erst was thickest fight, th' Angelic throng, And left large field, unsafe within the wind Of such commotion, such as to set forth Great things by small, If Natures concord broke, Among the Constellations warr were sprung, Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie, Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound. Together both with next to Almightie Arme, Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim'd That might determine, and not need repeate, As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd In might or swift prevention; but the sword Of Michael from the Armorie of God Was giv'n him temperd so, that neither keen Nor solid might resist that edge: it met The sword of Satan with steep force to smite Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid, But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar'd All his right side; then Satan first knew pain, And writh'd him to and fro convolv'd; so sore The griding sword with discontinuous wound Pass'd through him, but th' Ethereal substance clos'd Not long divisible, and from the gash A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow'd Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed, And all his Armour staind ere while so bright. Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run By Angels many and strong, who interpos'd Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir'd From off the files of warr; there they him laid Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame To find himself not matchless, and his pride Humbl'd by such rebuke, so farr beneath His confidence to equal God in power. Yet soon he heal'd; for Spirits that live throughout Vital in every part, not as frail man In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines; Cannot but by annihilating die; Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire: All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare, All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please, They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.  Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought, And with fierce Ensignes pierc'd the deep array Of Moloc furious King, who him defi'd, And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound Threatn'd, nor from the Holie One of Heav'n Refrein'd his tongue blasphemous; but anon Down clov'n to the waste, with shatterd Armes And uncouth paine fled bellowing.   On each wing Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe, Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd, Vanquish'd Adramelec, and Asmadai, Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods Disdain'd, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight, Mangl'd with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile, Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy The Atheist crew, but with redoubl'd blow Ariel and Arioc, and the violence Of Ramiel scorcht and blasted overthrew. I might relate of thousands, and thir names Eternize here on Earth; but those elect Angels contented with thir fame in Heav'n Seek not the praise of men: the other sort In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr, Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome Canceld from Heav'n and sacred memorie, Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell. For strength from Truth divided and from Just, Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame: Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome.  And now thir Mightiest quelld, the battel swerv'd, With many an inrode gor'd; deformed rout Enter'd, and foul disorder; all the ground With shiverd armour strow'n, and on a heap Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris'd, Then first with fear surpris'd and sense of paine Fled ignominious, to such evil brought By sin of disobedience, till that hour Not liable to fear or flight or paine. Far otherwise th' inviolable Saints In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc't entire, Invulnerable, impenitrably arm'd: Such high advantages thir innocence Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd, Not to have disobei'd; in fight they stood Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain'd By wound, though from thir place by violence mov'd.  Now Night her course began, and over Heav'n Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos'd, And silence on the odious dinn of Warr: Under her Cloudie covert both retir'd, Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field Michael and his Angels prevalent Encamping, plac'd in Guard thir Watches round, Cherubic waving fires: on th' other part Satan with his rebellious disappeerd, Far in the dark dislodg'd, and void of rest, His Potentates to Councel call'd by night; And in the midst thus undismai'd began.  O now in danger tri'd, now known in Armes Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare, Found worthy not of Libertie alone, Too mean pretense, but what we more affect, Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne, Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight (And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?) What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send Against us from about his Throne, and judg'd Sufficient to subdue us to his will, But proves not so: then fallible, it seems, Of future we may deem him, though till now Omniscient thought.   True is, less firmly arm'd, Some disadvantage we endur'd and paine, Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd, Since now we find this our Empyreal form Incapable of mortal injurie Imperishable, and though peirc'd with wound, Soon closing, and by native vigour heal'd. Of evil then so small as easie think The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes, Weapons more violent, when next we meet, May serve to better us, and worse our foes, Or equal what between us made the odds, In Nature none: if other hidden cause Left them Superiour, while we can preserve Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound, Due search and consultation will disclose.  He sat; and in th' assembly next upstood Nisroc of Principalities the prime; As one he stood escap't from cruel fight, Sore toild, his riv'n Armes to havoc hewn, And cIoudie in aspect thus answering spake. Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard For Gods, and too unequal work we find Against unequal armes to fight in paine, Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands Of Mightiest.   Sense of pleasure we may well Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine, But live content, which is the calmest life: But pain is perfet miserie, the worst Of evils, and excessive, overturnes All patience.   He who therefore can invent With what more forcible we may offend Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme Our selves with like defence, to me deserves No less then for deliverance what we owe.  Whereto with look compos'd Satan repli'd. Not uninvented that, which thou aright Believst so main to our success, I bring; Which of us who beholds the bright surface Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand, This continent of spacious Heav'n, adornd With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms & Gold, Whose Eye so superficially surveyes These things, as not to mind from whence they grow Deep under ground, materials dark and crude, Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht With Heav'ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth So beauteous, op'ning to the ambient light. These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep Shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame, Which into hallow Engins long and round Thick-rammd, at th' other bore with touch of fire Dilated and infuriate shall send forth From far with thundring noise among our foes Such implements of mischief as shall dash To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne, Effect shall end our wish.   Mean while revive; Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird. He ended, and his words thir drooping chere Enlightn'd, and thir languisht hope reviv'd. Th' invention all admir'd, and each, how hee To be th' inventer miss'd, so easie it seemd Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought Impossible: yet haply of thy Race In future dayes, if Malice should aboun, Some one intent on mischief, or inspir'd With dev'lish machination might devise Like instrument to plague the Sons of men For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent. Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew, None arguing stood, innumerable hands Were ready, in a moment up they turnd Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath Th' originals of Nature in thir crude Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame They found, they mingl'd, and with suttle Art, Concocted and adusted they reduc'd To blackest grain, and into store convey'd: Part hidd'n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone, Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls Of missive ruin; part incentive reed Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. So all ere day-spring, under conscious Night Secret they finish'd, and in order set, With silent circumspection unespi'd. Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav'n appeerd Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host, Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure, Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe, Where lodg'd, or whither fled, or if for fight, In motion or in alt: him soon they met Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri'd.  Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand, Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud He comes, and settl'd in his face I see Sad resolution and secure: let each His Adamantine coat gird well, and each Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield, Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down, If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr, But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire. So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon In order, quit of all impediment; Instant without disturb they took Allarm, And onward move Embattelld; when behold Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube Training his devilish Enginrie, impal'd On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep, To hide the fraud.   At interview both stood A while, but suddenly at head appeerd Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud.  Vanguard, to Right and Left the Front unfould; That all may see who hate us, how we seek Peace and composure, and with open brest Stand readie to receive them, if they like Our overture, and turn not back perverse; But that I doubt, however witness Heaven, Heav'n witness thou anon, while we discharge Freely our part; yee who appointed stand Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch What we propound, and loud that all may hear.  So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front Divided, and to either Flank retir'd. Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange, A triple mounted row of Pillars laid On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem'd Or hollow'd bodies made of Oak or Firr With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell'd) Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes With hideous orifice gap't on us wide, Portending hollow truce; at each behind A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense, Collected stood within our thoughts amus'd, Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli'd With nicest touch.   Immediate in a flame, But soon obscur'd with smoak, all Heav'n appeerd, From those deep throated Engins belcht, whose roar Emboweld with outragious noise the Air, And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule Thir devilish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host Level'd, with such impetuous furie smote, That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand, Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl'd; The sooner for thir Arms, unarm'd they might Have easily as Spirits evaded swift By quick contraction or remove; but now Foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout; Nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files. What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse Repeated, and indecent overthrow Doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd, And to thir foes a laughter; for in view Stood rankt of Seraphim another row In posture to displode thir second tire Of Thunder: back defeated to return They worse abhorr'd.   Satan beheld thir plight, And to his Mates thus in derision call'd.  O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud? Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee, To entertain them fair with open Front And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms Of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds, Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose If our proposals once again were heard We should compel them to a quick result.  To whom thus Belial in like gamesom mood, Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, Of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home, Such as we might perceive amus'd them all, And stumbl'd many, who receives them right, Had need from head to foot well understand; Not understood, this gift they have besides, They shew us when our foes walk not upright.  So they among themselves in pleasant veine Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond All doubt of Victorie, eternal might To match with thir inventions they presum'd So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn, And all his Host derided, while they stood A while in trouble; but they stood not long, Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac'd) Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills (For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale) Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew, From thir foundations loosning to and fro They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load, Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze, Be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel Host, When coming towards them so dread they saw The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd, Till on those cursed Engins triple-row They saw them whelm'd, and all thir confidence Under the weight of Mountains buried deep, Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads Main Promontories flung, which in the Air Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm'd, Thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and bruis'd Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain Implacable, and many a dolorous groan, Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. The rest in imitation to like Armes Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore; So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire That under ground, they fought in dismal shade; Infernal noise; Warr seem'd a civil Game To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav'n Had gon to wrack, with ruin overspred, Had not th' Almightie Father where he sits Shrin'd in his Sanctuarie of Heav'n secure, Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd: That his great purpose he might so fulfill, To honour his Anointed Son aveng'd Upon his enemies, and to declare All power on him transferr'd: whence to his Son Th' Assessor of his Throne he thus began. Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov'd, Son in whose face invisible is beheld Visibly, what by Deitie I am, And in whose hand what by Decree I doe, Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past, Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav'n, Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight, As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm'd; For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst, Equal in their Creation they were form'd, Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom; Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last Endless, and no solution will be found: Warr wearied hath perform'd what Warr can do, And to disorder'd rage let loose the reines, With Mountains as with Weapons arm'd, which makes Wild work in Heav'n, and dangerous to the maine. Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine; For thee I have ordain'd it, and thus farr Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou Can end it.   Into thee such Vertue and Grace Immense I have transfus'd, that all may know In Heav'n and Hell thy Power above compare, And this perverse Commotion governd thus, To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir Of all things, to be Heir and to be King By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right. Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might, Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles That shake Heav'ns basis, bring forth all my Warr, My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh; Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out From all Heav'ns bounds into the utter Deep: There let them learn, as likes them, to despise God and Messiah his anointed King.  He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct Shon full, he all his Father full expresst Ineffably into his face receiv'd, And thus the filial Godhead answering spake.  O Father, O Supream of heav'nly Thrones, First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee, As is most just; this I my Glorie account, My exaltation, and my whole delight, That thou in me well pleas'd, declarst thy will Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss. Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume, And gladlier shall resign, when in the end Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st: But whom thou hat'st, I hate, and can put on Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on, Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, Armd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd, To thir prepar'd ill Mansion driven down To chains of darkness, and th' undying Worm, That from thy just obedience could revolt, Whom to obey is happiness entire. Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th' impure Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount Unfained Halleluiahs to thee sing, Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief. So said, he o're his Scepter bowing, rose From the right hand of Glorie where he sate, And the third sacred Morn began to shine Dawning through Heav'n: forth rush'd with whirlwind sound The Chariot of Paternal Deitie, Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn, It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the wheels Of Beril, and careering Fires between; Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament, Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch. Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, Ascended, at his right hand Victorie Sate Eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his Bow And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor'd, And from about him fierce Effusion rowld Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire; Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, He onward came, farr off his coming shon, And twentie thousand (I thir number heard) Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen: Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime On the Chrystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron'd. Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz'd, When the great Ensign of Messiah blaz'd Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav'n: Under whose conduct Michael soon reduc'd His Armie, circumfus'd on either Wing, Under thir Head imbodied all in one. Before him Power Divine his way prepar'd; At his command the uprooted Hills retir'd Each to his place, they heard his voice and went Obsequious, Heav'n his wonted face renewd, And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil'd. This saw his hapless Foes but stood obdur'd, And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. In heav'nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? But to convince the proud what Signs availe, Or Wonders move th' obdurate to relent? They hard'nd more by what might most reclame, Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight Took envie, and aspiring to his highth, Stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile Against God and Messiah, or to fall In universal ruin last, and now To final Battel drew, disdaining flight, Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God To all his Host on either hand thus spake.  Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand Ye Angels arm'd, this day from Battel rest; Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause, And as ye have receivd, so have ye don Invincibly; but of this cursed crew The punishment to other hand belongs, Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints; Number to this dayes work is not ordain'd Nor multitude, stand onely and behold Gods indignation on these Godless pourd By mee, not you but mee they have despis'd, Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage, Because the Father, t' whom in Heav'n supream Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains, Hath honourd me according to his will. Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig'n'd; That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee In Battel which the stronger proves, they all, Or I alone against them, since by strength They measure all, of other excellence Not emulous, nor care who them excells; Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe.  So spake the Son, and into terrour chang'd His count'nance too severe to be beheld And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies. At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host. Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove, Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout, All but the Throne it self of God.   Full soon Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, All courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd; O're Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, That wisht the Mountains now might be again Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire. Nor less on either side tempestuous fell His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Foure, Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels Distinct alike with multitude of eyes, One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength, And of thir wonted vigour left them draind, Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n. Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n: The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd With terrors and with furies to the bounds And Chrystal wall of Heav'n, which op'ning wide, Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos'd Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight Strook them with horror backward, but far worse Urg'd them behind; headlong themselves they threw Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrauth Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.  Hell heard th' unsufferable noise, Hell saw Heav'n ruining from Heav'n and would have fled Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. Nine dayes they fell; confounded Chaos roard, And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos'd, Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine. Disburd'nd Heav'n rejoic'd, and soon repaird Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld. Sole Victor from th' expulsion of his Foes Messiah his triumphal Chariot turnd: To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts, With Jubilie advanc'd; and as they went, Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright, Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King, Son, Heir, and Lord, to him Dominion giv'n, Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode Triumphant through mid Heav'n, into the Courts And Temple of his migihtie Father Thron'd On high: who into Glorie him receav'd, Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.  Thus measuring things in Heav'n by things on Earth At thy request, and that thou maist beware By what is past, to thee I have reveal'd What might have else to human Race bin hid; The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav'n Among th' Angelic Powers, and the deep fall Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld With Satan, hee who envies now thy state, Who now is plotting how he may seduce Thee also from obedience, that with him Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake His punishment, Eternal miserie; Which would be all his solace and revenge, As a despite don against the most High, Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe. But list'n not to his Temptations, warne Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard By terrible Example the reward Of disobedience; firm they might have stood, Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.",
        "Paradise Lost: Book  8 (1674 version)": "THE Angel ended, and in Adams Eare So Charming left his voice, that he a while Thought him still speaking, still stood fixt to hear; Then as new wak't thus gratefully repli'd. What thanks sufficient, or what recompence Equal have I to render thee, Divine Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf't This friendly condescention to relate Things else by me unsearchable, now heard With wonder, but delight, and, as is due, With glorie attributed to the high Creator; something yet of doubt remaines, Which onely thy solution can resolve. When I behold this goodly Frame, this World Of Heav'n and Earth consisting, and compute, Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine, An Atom, with the Firmament compar'd And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle Spaces incomprehensible (for such Thir distance argues and thir swift return Diurnal) meerly to officiate light Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot, One day and night; in all thir vast survey Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire, How Nature wise and frugal could commit Such disproportions, with superfluous hand So many nobler Bodies to create, Greater so manifold to this one use, For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose Such restless revolution day by day Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth, That better might with farr less compass move, Serv'd by more noble then her self, attaines Her end without least motion, and receaves, As Tribute such a sumless journey brought Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light; Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes.  So spake our Sire, and by his count'nance seemd Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which Eve Perceaving where she sat retir'd in sight, With lowliness Majestic from her seat, And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay, Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours, To visit how they prosper'd, bud and bloom, Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew. Yet went she not, as not with such discourse Delighted, or not capable her eare Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv'd, Adam relating, she sole Auditress; Her Husband the Relater she preferr'd Before the Angel, and of him to ask Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermix Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip Not Words alone pleas'd her.   O when meet now Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn'd? With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went; Not unattended, for on her as Queen A pomp of winning Graces waited still, And from about her shot Darts of desire Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight. And Raphael now to Adam's doubt propos'd Benevolent and facil thus repli'd.  To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav'n Is as the Book of God before thee set, Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne His Seasons, Hours, or Dayes, or Months, or Yeares: This to attain, whether Heav'n move or Earth, Imports not, if thou reck'n right, the rest From Man or Angel the great Architect Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge His secrets to be scann'd by them who ought Rather admire; or if they list to try Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav'ns Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide Hereafter, when they come to model Heav'n And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear With Centric and Eccentric scribl'd o're, Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb: Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess, Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest That bodies bright and greater should not serve The less not bright, nor Heav'n such journies run, Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves The benefit: consider first, that Great Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth Though, in comparison of Heav'n, so small, Nor glistering, may of solid good containe More plenty then the Sun that barren shines Whose vertue on it self workes no effect, But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd His beams, unactive else, thir vigour find. Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries Officious, but to thee Earths habitant. And for the Heav'ns wide Circuit, let it speak The Makers high magnificence, who built So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr; That Man may know he dwells not in his own; An Edifice too large for him to fill, Lodg'd in a small partition, and the rest Ordain'd for uses to his Lord best known. The swiftness of those Circles attribute Though numberless, to his Omnipotence, That to corporeal substances could adde Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow, Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav'n Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv'd In Eden, distance inexpressible By Numbers that have name.   But this I urge, Admitting Motion in the Heav'ns, to shew Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov'd; Not that I so affirm, though so it seem To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth. God to remove his wayes from human sense, Plac'd Heav'n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight, If it presume, might erre in things too high, And no advantage gaine.   What if the Sun Be Center to the World, and other Starrs By his attractive vertue and thir own Incited, dance about him various rounds? Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid, Progressive, retrograde, or standing still, In six thou seest, and what if sev'nth to these The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem, Insensibly three different Motions move? Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe, Mov'd contrarie with thwart obliquities, Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos'd, Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe, If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day Travelling East, and with her part averse From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part Still luminous by his ray.   What if that light Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire, To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there, Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce Fruits in her soft'nd Soile, for some to eate Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie Communicating Male and Femal Light, Which two great Sexes animate the World, Stor'd in each Orb perhaps with some that live. For such vast room in Nature unpossest By living Soule, desert and desolate, Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr Down to this habitable, which returnes Light back to them, is obvious to dispute. But whether thus these things, or whether not, Whether the Sun predominant in Heav'n Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun Hee from the East his flaming rode begin, Or Shee from West her silent course advance With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev'n, And beares thee soft with the smooth Air along, Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid, Leave them to God above, him serve and feare; Of other Creatures, as him pleases best, Wherever plac't, let him dispose: joy thou In what he gives to thee, this Paradise And thy faire Eve; Heav'n is for thee too high To know what passes there; be lowlie wise:. Think onely what concernes thee and thy being; Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there Live, in what state, condition or degree, Contented that thus farr hath been reveal'd Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav'n.  To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli'd. How fully hast thou satisfi'd mee, pure Intelligence of Heav'n, Angel serene, And freed from intricacies, taught to live, The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares, And not molest us, unless we our selves Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vain. But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end; Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she learne, That not to know at large of things remote From use, obscure and suttle, but to know That which before us lies in daily life, Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume, Or emptiness, or fond impertinence, And renders us in things that most concerne Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and still to seek. Therefore from this high pitch let us descend A lower flight, and speak of things at hand Useful, whence haply mention may arise Of somthing not unseasonable to ask By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign'd. Thee I have heard relating what was don Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard; And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest How suttly to detaine thee I devise, Inviting thee to hear while I relate, Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply: For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav'n, And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst And hunger both, from labour, at the houre Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine Imbu'd, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. To whom thus Raphael answer'd heav'nly meek.  Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee Abundantly his gifts hath also pour'd Inward and outward both, his image faire: Speaking or mute all comliness and grace Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes, Nor less think wee in Heav'n of thee on Earth Then of our fellow servant, and inquire Gladly into the wayes of God with Man: For God we see hath honour'd thee, and set On Man his Equal Love: say therefore on; For I that Day was absent, as befell, Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell; Squar'd in full Legion (such command we had) To see that none thence issu'd forth a spie, Or enemie, while God was in his work, Least hee incenst at such eruption bold, Destruction with Creation might have mixt. Not that they durst without his leave attempt, But us he sends upon his high behests For state, as Sovran King, and to enure Our prompt obedience.   Fast we found, fast shut The dismal Gates, and barricado'd strong; But long ere our approaching heard within Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song, Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage. Glad we return'd up to the coasts of Light Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge. But thy relation now; for I attend, Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with mine.  So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. For Man to tell how human Life began Is hard; for who himself beginning knew? Desire with thee still longer to converse Induc'd me.   As new wak't from soundest sleep Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed. Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd, And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd By quick instinctive motion up I sprung, As thitherward endevoring, and upright Stood on my feet; about me round I saw Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines, And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these, Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew, Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd, With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd. My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran With supple joints, and lively vigour led: But who I was, or where, or from what cause, Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake My Tongue obey'd and readily could name What e're I saw.   Thou Sun, said I, faire Light, And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay, Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines, And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? Not of my self; by some great Maker then, In goodness and in power praeeminent; Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, From whom I have that thus I move and live, And feel that I am happier then I know. While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither, From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld This happie Light, when answer none return'd, On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought I then was passing to my former state Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: When suddenly stood at my Head a dream, Whose inward apparition gently mov'd My fancy to believe I yet had being, And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine, And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, rise, First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd. So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd, And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire Smooth sliding without step, last led me up A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine, A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemd.   Each Tree Load'n with fairest Fruit that hung to the Eye Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide Up hither, from among the Trees appeer'd Presence Divine.   Rejoycing, but with aw In adoration at his feet I fell Submiss: he rear'd me, and Whom thou soughtst I am, Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest Above, or round about thee or beneath. This Paradise I give thee, count it thine To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate: Of every Tree that in the Garden growes Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: But of the Tree whose operation brings Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste, And shun the bitter consequence: for know, The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye; From that day mortal, and this happie State Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a World Of woe and sorrow.   Sternly he pronounc'd The rigid interdiction, which resounds Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect Return'd and gracious purpose thus renew'd. Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords Possess it, and all things that therein live, Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle. In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold After thir kindes; I bring them to receave From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie With low subjection; understand the same Of Fish within thir watry residence, Not hither summond, since they cannot change Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire. As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold Approaching two and two, These cowring low With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his wing. I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and understood Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu'd My sudden apprehension: but in these I found not what me thought I wanted still; And to the Heav'nly vision thus presum'd.  O by what Name, for thou above all these, Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher, Surpassest farr my naming, how may I Adore thee, Author of this Universe, And all this good to man, for whose well being So amply, and with hands so liberal Thou hast provided all things: but with mee I see not who partakes.   In solitude What happiness, who can enjoy alone, Or all enjoying, what contentment find? Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright, As with a smile more bright'nd, thus repli'd. What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth With various living creatures, and the Aire Replenisht, and all these at thy command To come and play before thee, know'st thou not Thir language and thir wayes, they also know, And reason not contemptibly; with these Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large. So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd So ordering.   I with leave of speech implor'd, And humble deprecation thus repli'd.  Let not my words offend thee, Heav'nly Power, My Maker, be propitious while I speak. Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, And these inferiour farr beneath me set? Among unequals what societie Can sort, what harmonie or true delight? Which must be mutual, in proportion due Giv'n and receiv'd; but in disparitie The one intense, the other still remiss Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak Such as I seek, fit to participate All rational delight, wherein the brute Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness; So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd; Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape; Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all. Whereto th' Almighty answer'd, not displeas'd.  A nice and suttle happiness I see Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice Of thy Associates, Adam, and wilt taste No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie. What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State, Seem I to thee sufficiently possest Of happiness, or not? who am alone From all Eternitie, for none I know Second to me or like, equal much less. How have I then with whom to hold converse Save with the Creatures which I made, and those To me inferiour, infinite descents Beneath what other Creatures are to thee? He ceas'd, I lowly answer'd.   To attaine The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes All human thoughts come short, Supream of things; Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee Is no deficience found; not so is Man, But in degree, the cause of his desire By conversation with his like to help, Or solace his defects.   No need that thou Shouldst propagat, already infinite; And through all numbers absolute, though One; But Man by number is to manifest His single imperfection, and beget Like of his like, his Image multipli'd, In unitie defective, which requires Collateral love, and deerest amitie. Thou in thy secresie although alone, Best with thy self accompanied, seek'st not Social communication, yet so pleas'd, Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt Of Union or Communion, deifi'd; I by conversing cannot these erect From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find. Thus I embold'nd spake, and freedom us'd Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain'd This answer from the gratious voice Divine.  Thus farr to try thee, Adam, I was pleas'd, And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone, Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thy self, Expressing well the spirit within thee free, My Image, not imparted to the Brute, Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike, And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak'st, Knew it not good for Man to be alone, And no such companie as then thou saw'st Intended thee, for trial onely brought, To see how thou could'st judge of fit and meet: What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd, Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, Thy wish exactly to thy hearts desire.  Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now My earthly by his Heav'nly overpowerd, Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth In that celestial Colloquie sublime, As with an object that excels the sense, Dazl d and spent, sunk down, and sought repair Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call'd By Nature as in aide, and clos'd mine eyes. Mine eyes he clos'd, but op'n left the Cell Of Fancie my internal sight, by which Abstract as in a transe methought I saw, Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape Still glorious before whom awake I stood; Who stooping op'nd my left side, and took From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme, And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, But suddenly with flesh fill'd up and heal'd: The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands; Under his forming hands a Creature grew, Manlike, but different Sex, so lovly faire, That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd And in her looks, which from that time infus'd Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, And into all things from her Aire inspir'd The spirit of love and amorous delight. Shee disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak'd To find her, or for ever to deplore Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: When out of hope, behold her, not farr off, Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow To make her amiable: On she came, Led by her Heav'nly Maker, though unseen, And guided by his voice, nor uninformd Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites: Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her Eye, In every gesture dignitie and love. I overjoyd could not forbear aloud.  This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill'd Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne, Giver of all things faire, but fairest this Of all thy gifts, nor enviest.   I now see Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere; And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule.  She heard me thus, and though divinely brought, Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie, Her vertue and the conscience of her worth, That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won, Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir'd, The more desirable, or to say all, Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought, Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn'd; I follow'd her, she what was Honour knew, And with obsequious Majestie approv'd My pleaded reason.   To the Nuptial Bowre I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav'n, And happie Constellations on that houre Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill; Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires Whisper'd it to the Woods, and from thir wings Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub, Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp. Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss Which I enjoy, and must confess to find In all things else delight indeed, but such As us'd or not, works in the mind no change, Nor vehement desire, these delicacies I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, and Flours, Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here Farr otherwise, transported I behold, Transported touch; here passion first I felt, Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance. Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part Not proof enough such Object to sustain, Or from my side subducting, took perhaps More then enough; at least on her bestow'd Too much of Ornament, in outward shew Elaborate, of inward less exact. For well I understand in the prime end Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the mind And inward Faculties, which most excell, In outward also her resembling less His Image who made both, and less expressing The character of that Dominion giv'n O're other Creatures; yet when I approach Her loveliness, so absolute she seems And in her self compleat, so well to know Her own, that what she wills to do or say, Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best; All higher knowledge in her presence falls Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly shewes; Authority and Reason on her waite, As one intended first, not after made Occasionally; and to consummate all, Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat Build in her loveliest, and create an awe About her, as a guard Angelic plac't. To whom the Angel with contracted brow.  Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part; Do thou but thine, and be not diffident Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh, By attributing overmuch to things Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav'st. For what admir'st thou, what transports thee so, An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love, Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self; Then value: Oft times nothing profits more Then self esteem, grounded on just and right Well manag'd; of that skill the more thou know'st, The more she will acknowledge thee her Head, And to realities yield all her shows: Made so adorn for thy delight the more, So awful, that with honour thou maist love Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise. But if the sense of touch whereby mankind Is propagated seem such dear delight Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf't To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be To them made common and divulg'd, if aught Therein enjoy'd were worthy to subdue The Soule of Man, or passion in him move. What higher in her societie thou findst Attractive, human, rational, love still; In loving thou dost well, in passion not, Wherein true Love consists not; love refines The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale By which to heav'nly Love thou maist ascend, Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found.  To whom thus half abash't Adam repli'd. Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught In procreation common to all kindes (Though higher of the genial Bed by far, And with mysterious reverence I deem) So much delights me as those graceful acts, Those thousand decencies that daily flow From all her words and actions mixt with Love And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign'd Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule; Harmonie to behold in wedded pair More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare. Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild, Who meet with various objects, from the sense Variously representing; yet still free Approve the best, and follow what I approve. To love thou blam'st me not, for love thou saist Leads up to Heav'n, is both the way and guide; Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask; Love not the heav'nly Spirits, and how thir Love Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?  To whom the Angel with a smile that glow'd Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue, Answer'd.   Let it suffice thee that thou know'st Us happie, and without Love no happiness. Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy In eminence, and obstacle find none Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs: Easier then Air with Air; if Spirits embrace, Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure Desiring; nor restrain'd conveyance need As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul. But I can now no more; the parting Sun Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles Hesperean sets, my Signal to depart. Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all Him whom to love is to obey, and keep His great command; take heed least Passion sway Thy judgement to do aught, which else free Will Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons The weal or woe in thee is plac't; beware. I in thy persevering shall rejoyce, And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies. Perfet within, no outward aid require; And all temptation to transgress repel.  So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus Follow'd with benediction.   Since to part, Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger, Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore. Gentle to me and affable hath been Thy condescension, and shall be honour'd ever With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind Be good and friendly still, and oft return.  So parted they, the Angel up to Heav'n From the thick shade, and Adam to his Bowre.",
        "Paradise Lost: Book 10 (1674 version)": "MEanwhile the hainous and despightfull act Of Satan done in Paradise, and how Hee in the Serpent, had perverted Eve, Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit, Was known in Heav'n; for what can scape the Eye Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart Omniscient, who in all things wise and just, Hinder'd not Satan to attempt the minde Of Man, with strength entire, and free will arm'd, Complete to have discover'd and repulst Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend. For still they knew, and ought to have still remember'd The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit, Whoever tempted; which they not obeying, Incurr'd, what could they less, the penaltie, And manifold in sin, deserv'd to fall. Up into Heav'n from Paradise in haste Th' Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad For Man, for of his state by this they knew, Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln Entrance unseen. Soon as th' unwelcome news From Earth arriv'd at Heaven Gate, displeas'd All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare That time Celestial visages, yet mixt With pitie, violated not thir bliss. About the new-arriv'd, in multitudes Th' ethereal People ran, to hear and know How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream Accountable made haste to make appear With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance, And easily approv'd; when the most High Eternal Father from his secret Cloud, Amidst in Thunder utter'd thus his voice.  Assembl'd Angels, and ye Powers return'd From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid, Nor troubl'd at these tidings from the Earth, Which your sincerest care could not prevent, Foretold so lately what would come to pass, When first this Tempter cross'd the Gulf from Hell. I told ye then he should prevail and speed On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc't And flatter'd out of all, believing lies Against his Maker; no Decree of mine Concurring to necessitate his Fall, Or touch with lightest moment of impulse His free Will, to her own inclining left In eevn scale. But fall'n he is, and now What rests but that the mortal Sentence pass On his transgression, Death denounc't that day, Which he presumes already vain and void, Because not yet inflicted, as he fear'd, By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find Forbearance no acquittance ere day end. Justice shall not return as bountie scorn'd. But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr'd All Judgement, whether in Heav'n, or Earth, or Hell. Easie it might be seen that I intend Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design'd Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie, And destin'd Man himself to judge Man fall'n.  So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son Blaz'd forth unclouded Deitie; he full Resplendent all his Father manifest Express'd, and thus divinely answer'd milde.  Father Eternal, thine is to decree, Mine both in Heav'n and Earth to do thy will Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov'd Mayst ever rest well pleas'd. I go to judge On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst, Whoever judg'd, the worst on mee must light, When time shall be, for so I undertook Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom On me deriv'd, yet I shall temper so Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most Them fully satisfied, and thee appease. Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none Are to behold the Judgment, but the judg'd, Those two; the third best absent is condemn'd, Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law Conviction to the Serpent none belongs.  Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers, Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence Eden and all the Coast in prospect lay. Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing'd. Now was the Sun in Western cadence low From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour To fan the Earth now wak'd, and usher in The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes Brought to thir Ears, while day declin'd, they heard, And from his presence hid themselves among The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God Approaching, thus to Adam call'd aloud.  Where art thou Adam, wont with joy to meet My coming seen far off? I miss thee here, Not pleas'd, thus entertaind with solitude, Where obvious dutie erewhile appear'd unsaught: Or come I less conspicuous, or what change Absents thee, or what chance detains? Come forth. He came, and with him Eve, more loth, though first To offend, discount'nanc't both, and discompos'd; Love was not in thir looks, either to God Or to each other, but apparent guilt, And shame, and perturbation, and despaire, Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile. Whence Adam faultring long, thus answer'd brief.  I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice Affraid, being naked, hid my self. To whom The gracious judge without revile repli'd.  My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear'd, But still rejoyc't, how is it now become So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?  To whom thus Adam sore beset repli'd. O Heav'n! in evil strait this day I stand Before my judge, either to undergoe My self the total Crime, or to accuse My other self, the partner of my life; Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines, I should conceal, and not expose to blame By my complaint; but strict necessitie Subdues me, and calamitous constraint Least on my head both sin and punishment, However insupportable, be all Devolv'd; though should I hold my peace, yet thou Wouldst easily detect what I conceale. This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help, And gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good, So fit, so acceptable, so Divine, That from her hand I could suspect no ill, And what she did, whatever in it self, Her doing seem'd to justifie the deed; Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate.  To whom the sovran Presence thus repli'd. Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide, Superior, or but equal, that to her Thou did'st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, And for thee, whose perfection farr excell'd Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd Shee was indeed, and lovely to attract Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts Were such as under Government well seem'd, Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part And person, had'st thou known thy self aright.  So having said, he thus to Eve in few: Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done?  To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelm'd, Confessing soon, yet not before her judge Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd.  The Serpent me beguil'd and I did eate.  Which when the Lord God heard, without delay To Judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd Serpent though brute, unable to transferre The Guilt on him who made him instrument Of mischief, and polluted from the end Of his Creation; justly then accurst, As vitiated in Nature: more to know Concern'd not Man (since he no further knew) Nor alter'd his offence; yet God at last To Satan first in sin his doom apply'd, Though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best: And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.  Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst Above all Cattle, each Beast of the Field; Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe, And dust shalt eat all the dayes of thy Life. Between Thee and the Woman I will put Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed; Her Seed shall bruse thy head, thou bruise his heel.  So spake this Oracle, then verifi'd When Jesus son of Mary second Eve, Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n, Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht In open shew, and with ascention bright Captivity led captive through the Aire, The Realm it self of Satan long usurpt, Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; Eeven hee who now foretold his fatal bruise, And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn'd.  Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule.  On Adam last thus judgement he pronounc'd. Because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy Wife, And eaten of the Tree concerning which I charg'd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof, Curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life; Thorns also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth Unbid, and thou shalt eate th' Herb of th' Field, In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eat Bread, Till thou return unto the ground, for thou Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth, For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne.  So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent, And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood Before him naked to the aire, that now Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin Thenceforth the form of servant to assume, As when he wash'd his servants feet so now As Father of his Familie he clad Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain, Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid; And thought not much to cloath his Enemies: Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness, Araying cover'd from his Fathers sight. To him with swift ascent he up returnd, Into his blissful bosom reassum'd In glory as of old, to him appeas'd All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth, Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death, In counterview within the Gates, that now Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame Farr into Chaos, since the Fiend pass'd through, Sin opening, who thus now to Death began.  O Son, why sit we here each other viewing Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides For us his ofspring deare; It cannot be But that success attends him; if mishap, Ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n By his Avenger, since no place like this Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, Wings growing, and Dominion giv'n me large Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on, Or sympathie, or som connatural force Powerful at greatest distance to unite With secret amity things of like kinde By secretest conveyance. Thou my Shade Inseparable must with mee along: For Death from Sin no power can separate. But least the difficultie of passing back Stay his return perhaps over this Gulfe Impassable, Impervious, let us try Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine Not unagreeable, to found a path Over this Maine from Hell to that new World Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument Of merit high to all th' infernal Host, Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse, Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead. Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn By this new felt attraction and instinct.  Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon. Goe whither Fate and inclination strong Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste The savour of Death from all things there that live: Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.  So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote, Against the day of Battel, to a Field, Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd With sent of living Carcasses design'd For death, the following day, in bloodie fight. So sented the grim Feature, and upturn'd His Nostril wide into the murkie Air, Sagacious of his Quarry from so farr. Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste Wide Anarchie of Chaos damp and dark Flew divers, and with Power (thir Power was great) Hovering upon the Waters; what they met Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea Tost up and down, together crowded drove From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell. As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive Mountains of Ice, that stop th' imagin'd way Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soyle Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry, As with a Trident smote, and fix't as firm As Delos floating once; the rest his look Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move, And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the Gate, Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather'd beach They fasten'd, and the Mole immense wraught on Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall Immovable of this now fenceless world Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell. So, if great things to small may be compar'd, Xerxes, the Libertie of Greece to yoke, From Susa his Memnonian Palace high Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joyn'd, And scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves. Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock Over the vext Abyss, following the track Of Satan, to the self same place where hee First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe From out of Chaos to the out side bare Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made And durable; and now in little space The confines met of Empyrean Heav'n And of this World, and on the left hand Hell With long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes In sight, to each of these three places led. And now thir way to Earth they had descri'd, To Paradise first tending, when behold Satan in likeness of an Angel bright Betwixt the Centaure and the Scorpion stearing His Zenith, while the Sun in Aries rose: Disguis'd he came, but those his Children dear Thir Parent soon discern'd, though in disguise. Hee after Eve seduc't, unminded slunk Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought Vain covertures; but when he saw descend The Son of God to judge them terrifi'd Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth Might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd By Night, and listening where the hapless Paire Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint, Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood Not instant, but of future time. With joy And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return'd, And at the brink of Chaos, neer the foot Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear. Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas'd. Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke.  O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds, Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own, Thou art thir Author and prime Architect: For I no sooner in my Heart divin'd, My Heart, which by a secret harmonie Still moves with thine, join'd in connexion sweet, That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks Now also evidence, but straight I felt Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt That I must after thee with this thy Son; Such fatal consequence unites us three: Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure Detain from following thy illustrious track. Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd Within Hell Gates till, now, thou us impow'rd To fortifie thus farr, and overlay With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss. Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign, There didst not; there let him still Victor sway, As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World Retiring, by his own doom alienated, And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide Of all things parted by th' Empyreal bounds, His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World, Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne.  Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad. Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both, High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race Of Satan (for I glorie in the name, Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King) Amply have merited of me, of all Th' infernal Empire, that so neer Heav'ns dore Triumphal with triumphal act have met, Mine with this glorious Work, and made one Realm Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease To my associate Powers, them to acquaint With these successes, and with them rejoyce, You two this way, among these numerous Orbs All yours, right down to Paradise descend; There dwell and Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth Dominion exercise and in the Aire, Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd, Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. My Substitutes I send ye, and Create Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now My hold of this new Kingdom all depends, Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit. If your joynt power prevailes, th' affaires of Hell No detriment need feare, goe and be strong.  So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed Thir course through thickest Constellations held Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan, And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips Then sufferd. Th' other way Satan went down The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd, And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate, Wide open and unguarded, Satan pass'd, And all about found desolate; for those Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, Flown to the upper World; the rest were all Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls Of Pandaemonium, Citie and proud seate Of Lucifer, so by allusion calld, Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond. There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand In Council sate, sollicitous what chance Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee Departing gave command, and they observ'd. As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond The Realm of Aladule, in his retreate To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting Each hour their great adventurer from the search Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, In shew Plebeian Angel militant Of lowest order, past; and from the dore Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible Ascended his high Throne, which under state Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end Was plac't in regal lustre. Down a while He sate, and round about him saw unseen: At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad With what permissive glory since his fall Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld, Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime: Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers, Rais'd from thir Dark Divan, and with like joy Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand Silence, and with these words attention won.  Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, For in possession such, not onely of right, I call ye and declare ye now, returnd Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth Triumphant out of this infernal Pit Abominable, accurst, the house of woe, And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess, As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven Little inferiour, by my adventure hard With peril great atchiev'd. Long were to tell What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine Voyag'd th' unreal, vast, unbounded deep Of horrible confusion, over which By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd To expedite your glorious march; but I Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde, That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd My journey strange, with clamorous uproare Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found The new created World, which fame in Heav'n Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful Of absolute perfection, therein Man Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile Made happie; Him by fraud I have seduc'd From his Creator, and the more to increase Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up Both his beloved Man and all his World, To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, Without our hazard, labour, or allarme, To range in, and to dwell, and over Man To rule, as over all he should have rul'd. True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs, Is enmity, which he will put between Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: A World who would not purchase with a bruise, Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th' account Of my performance: What remains, ye Gods, But up and enter now into full bliss.  So having said, a while he stood, expecting Thir universal shout and high applause To fill his eare, when contrary he hears On all sides, from innumerable tongues A dismal universal hiss, the sound Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long Had leasure, wondring at himself now more; His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining Each other, till supplanted down he fell A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd, According to his doom: he would have spoke, But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd Alike, to Serpents all as accessories To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now With complicated monsters head and taile, Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear, And Dipsas (not so thick swarm'd once the Soil Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime, Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem'd Above the rest still to retain; they all Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field, Where all yet left of that revolted Rout Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array, Sublime with expectation when to see ln Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief; They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell, And horrid sympathie; for what they saw, They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast, And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment, As in thir crime. Thus was th' applause they meant, Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, His will who reigns above, to aggravate Thir penance, laden with Fruit like that Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining For one forbidden Tree a multitude Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame; Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, Though to delude them sent, could not abstain, But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks That curld Megaera: greedily they pluck'd The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam'd; This more delusive, not the touch, but taste Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, With hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws With soot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell Into the same illusion, not as Man Whom they triumph'd once lapst. Thus were they plagu'd And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss, Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd, Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo This annual humbling certain number'd days, To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't. However some tradition they dispers'd Among the Heathen of thir purchase got, And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld Ophion with Eurynome, the wide- Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv'n And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair Too soon arriv'd, Sin there in power before, Once actual, now in body, and to dwell Habitual habitant; behind her Death Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began.  Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death, What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd With travail difficult, not better farr Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch, Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd?  Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon. To mee, who with eternal Famin pine, Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven, There best, where most with ravin I may meet; Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps.  To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd. Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, and Flours Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle, No homely morsels, and whatever thing The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd, Till I in Man residing through the Race, His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, And season him thy last and sweetest prey.  This said, they both betook them several wayes, Both to destroy, or unimmortal make All kinds, and for destruction to mature Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing, From his transcendent Seat the Saints among, To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice.  See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance To waste and havoc yonder World, which I So fair and good created, and had still Kept in that State, had not the folly of Man Let in these wastful Furies, who impute Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell And his Adherents, that with so much ease I suffer them to enter and possess A place so heav'nly, and conniving-seem To gratifie my scornful Enemies, That laugh, as if transported with some fit Of Passion, I to them had quitted all, At random yielded up to their misrule; And know not that I call'd and drew them thither My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst With suckt and glutted offal, at one sling Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son, Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last Through Chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes. Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure To sanctitie that shall receive no staine: Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes.  He ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas, Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways, Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works; Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son, Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise, Or down from Heav'n descend. Such was thir song, While the Creator calling forth by name His mightie Angels gave them several charge, As sorted best with present things. The Sun Had first his precept so to move, so shine, As might affect the Earth with cold and heat Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five Thir planetarie motions and aspects In Sextile, Square, and Trine, and Opposite, Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt Thir influence malignant when to showre, Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling, Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set Thir corners, when with bluster to confound Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle With terror through the dark Aereal Hall. Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav'n Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amaine By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales, As deep as Capricorne, to bring in change Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours, Equal in Days and Nights, except to those Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun To recompence his distance, in thir sight Had rounded still th' Horizon, and not known Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow From cold Estotiland, and South as farr Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turn'd His course intended; else how had the World Inhabited, though sinless, more then now, Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast, Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot, Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shoar Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn; With adverse blast upturns them from the South Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Windes Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise, Sirocco, and Libecchio, Thus began Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational, Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie: Beast now with Beast gan war, and Fowle with Fowle, And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving, Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim Glar'd on him passing: these were from without The growing miseries, which Adam saw Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost, Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint.  O miserable of happie! is this the end Of this new glorious World, and mee so late The Glory of that Glory, who now becom Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face Of God, whom to behold was then my highth Of happiness: yet well, if here would end The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare My own deservings; but this will not serve; All that I eat or drink, or shall beget, Is propagated curse. O voice once heard Delightfully, Encrease and multiply, Now death to heare! for what can I encrease Or multiplie, but curses on my head? Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling The evil on him brought by me, will curse My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure, For this we may thank Adam; but his thanks Shall be the execration; so besides Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, On mee as on thir natural center light Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee From darkness to promote me, or here place In this delicious Garden? as my Will Concurd not to my being, it were but right And equal to reduce me to my dust, Desirous to resigne, and render back All I receav'd, unable to performe Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold The good I sought not. To the loss of that, Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added The sense of endless woes? inexplicable Thy justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, I thus contest; then should have been refusd Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd: Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, Then cavil the conditions? and though God Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort, Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not: Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, But Natural necessity begot. God made thee of choice his own, and of his own To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: O welcom hour whenever! why delayes His hand to execute what his Decree Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth Insensible, how glad would lay me down As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse To mee and to my ofspring would torment me With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt Pursues me still, least all I cannot die, Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, Or in some other dismal place who knows But I shall die a living Death? O thought Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. All of me then shall die: let this appease The doubt, since humane reach no further knows. For though the Lord of all be infinite, Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, But mortal doom'd. How can he exercise Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end? Can he make deathless Death? that were to make Strange contradiction, which to God himself Impossible is held, as Argument Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out, For angers sake, finite to infinite In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour Satisfi'd never; that were to extend His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law, By which all Causes else according still To the reception of thir matter act, Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare. But say That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd, Bereaving sense, but endless miserie From this day onward, which 1 feel begun Both in me, and without me, and so last To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution On my defensless head; both Death and I Am found Eternal, and incorporate both, Nor I on my part single, in mee all Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able To waste it all my self, and leave ye none! So disinherited how would ye bless Me now your curse! Ah, why should all mankind For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd, If guiltless? But from me what can proceed, But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd, Not to do onely, but to will the same With me? how can they then acquitted stand In sight of God? Him after all Disputes Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain, And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still But to my own conviction: first and last On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; So might the wrauth. Fond wish! couldst thou support That burden heavier then the Earth to bear Then all the World much heavier, though divided With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir'st And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable Beyond all past example and future, To Satan only like both crime and doom. O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd!  Thus Adam to himself lamented loud Through the still Night, not now, as ere man fell, Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, Which to his evil Conscience represented All things with double terror: On the Ground Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd Of tardie execution, since denounc't The day of his offence. Why comes not Death, Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, Justice Divine not hast'n to be just? But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs, With other echo late I taught your Shades To answer, and resound farr other Song. Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve bebeld, Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd: But her with stern regard he thus repell'd.  Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee I had persisted happie, had not thy pride And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd Not to be trusted, longing to be seen Though by the Devil himself, him overweening To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee, To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise, Constant, mature, proof against all assaults, And understood not all was but a shew Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, More to the part sinister from me drawn, Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie To my just number found. O why did God, Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n With Spirits Masculine, create at last This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect Of Nature, and not fill the World at once With Men as Angels without Feminine, Or find some other way to generate Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n, And more that shall befall, innumerable Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares, And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either He never shall find out fit Mate, but such As some misfortune brings him, or mistake, Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain Through her perversness, but shall see her gaind By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld By Parents, or his happiest choice too late Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame: Which infinite calamitie shall cause To Humane life, and houshold peace confound.  He added not, and from her turn'd, but Eve Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing, And tresses all disorderd, at his feet Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.  Forsake me not thus, Adam, witness Heav'n What love sincere, and reverence in my heart I beare thee, and unweeting have offended, Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, Thy counsel in this uttermost distress, My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, Between us two let there be peace, both joyning, As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us, That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n, On me alreadie lost, mee then thy self More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou Against God onely, I against God and thee, And to the place of judgment will return, There with my cries importune Heaven, that all The sentence from thy head remov'd may light On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, Mee mee onely just object of his ire.  She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, Immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in Adam wraught Commiseration; soon his heart relented Towards her, his life so late and sole delight, Now at his feet submissive in distress, Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide; As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost, And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon.  Unwarie, and too desirous, as before, So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st The punishment all on thy self; alas, Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers Could alter high Decrees, I to that place Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, That on my head all might be visited, Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n, To me committed and by me expos'd. But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive In offices of Love, how we may light'n Each others burden in our share of woe; Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see, Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill, A long days dying to augment our paine, And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd.  To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, repli'd. Adam, by sad experiment I know How little weight my words with thee can finde, Found so erroneous, thence by just event Found so unfortunate; nevertheless, Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart Living or dying, from thee I will not hide What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n, Tending to some relief of our extremes, Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, As in our evils, and of easier choice. If care of our descent perplex us most, Which must be born to certain woe, devourd By Death at last, and miserable it is To be to others cause of misery, Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring Into this cursed World a woful Race, That after wretched Life must be at last Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot. Childless thou art, Childless remaine: so Death Shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two Be forc'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw. But if thou judge it hard and difficult, Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain From Loves due Rites, Nuptial imbraces sweet, And with desire to languish without hope, Before the present object languishing With like desire, which would be meserie And torment less then none of what we dread, Then both our selves and Seed at once to free From what we fear for both, let us make short, Let us seek Death, or he not found, supply With our own hands his Office on our selves; Why stand we longer shivering under feares, That shew no end but Death, and have the power, Of many ways to die the shortest choosing, Destruction with destruction to destroy.  She ended heer, or vehement despaire Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale. But Adam with such counsel nothing sway'd, To better hopes his more attentive minde Labouring had rais'd, and thus to Eve repli'd.  Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems To argue in thee somthing more sublime And excellent then what thy minde contemnes; But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes That excellence thought in thee, and implies, Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd. Or if thou covet death, as utmost end Of miserie, so thinking to evade The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine We are by doom to pay; rather such acts Of contumacie will provoke the highest To make death in us live: Then let us seek Some safer resolution, which methinks I have in view, calling to minde with heed Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe Satan, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd Against us this deceit: to crush his head Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost By death brought on our selves, or childless days Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe Shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee Instead shall double ours upon our heads. No more be mention'd then of violence Against our selves, and wilful barrenness, That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely Rancor and pride, impatience and despite, Reluctance against God and his just yoke Laid on our Necks. Remember with what mild And gracious temper he both heard and judg'd Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected Immediate dissolution, which we thought Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold, And bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy, Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope Glanc'd on the ground, with labour I must earne My bread; what harm? Idleness had bin worse; My labour will sustain me; and least Cold Or Heat should injure us, his timely care Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands Cloath'd us unworthie, pitying while he judg'd; How much more, if we pray him, will his ear Be open, and his heart to pitie incline, And teach us further by what means to shun Th' inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow, Which now the Skie with various Face begins To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish Our Limbs benumm'd, ere this diurnal Starr Leave cold the Night, how we his gather'd beams Reflected, may with matter sere foment, Or by collision of two bodies grinde The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv'n down Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine, And sends a comfortable heat from farr, Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use, And what may else be remedie or cure To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace Beseeching him, so as we need not fear To pass commodiously this life, sustain'd By him with many comforts, till we end In dust, our final rest and native home. What better can we do, then to the place Repairing where he judg'd us, prostrate fall Before him reverent, and there confess Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears Watering the ground, and with our sighs the Air Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek. Undoubtedly he will relent and turn From his displeasure; in whose look serene, When angry most he seem'd and most severe, What else but favor, grace, and mercie shon?  So spake our Father penitent, nor Eve Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place Repairing where he judg'd them prostrate fell Before him reverent, and both confess'd Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg'd, with tears Watering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.",
        "At a Solemn Music": "Blest pair of Sirens, pledges of Heav'ns joy, \nSphear-born harmonious Sisters, Voice, and Vers, \nWed your divine sounds, and mixt power employ \nDead things with inbreath'd sense able to pierce, \nAnd to our high-rais'd phantasie present,\nThat undisturbed Song of pure content, \nAy sung before the saphire-colour'd throne \nTo him that sits theron With Saintly shout, and solemn Jubily, \nWhere the bright Seraphim in burning row\nTheir loud up-lifted Angel trumpets blow, \nAnd the Cherubick host in thousand quires \nTouch their immortal Harps of golden wires, \nWith those just Spirits that wear victorious Palms, \nHymns devout and holy Psalms\nSinging everlastingly; \nThat we on Earth with undiscording voice \nMay rightly answer that melodious noise; \nAs once we did, till disproportion'd sin \nJarr'd against natures chime, and with harsh din\nBroke the fair musick that all creatures made \nTo their great Lord, whose love their motion sway'd \nIn perfect Diapason, whilst they stood \nIn first obedience, and their state of good. \nO may we soon again renew that Song\nAnd keep in tune with Heav'n, till God ere long \nTo his celestial consort us unite, \nTo live with him, and sing in endles morn of light.",
        "Paradise Lost: Book  1 (1674 version)": "OF Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit\n Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast\n Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,\n With loss of Eden, till one greater Man\n Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,\n Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top\n Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire\n That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,\n In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth\n Rose out of Chaos: or if Sion Hill\n Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flow'd\n Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence\n Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,\n That with no middle flight intends to soar\n Above th' Aonian Mount, while it pursues\n Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.\n And chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer\n Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,\n Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first\n Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread\n Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss\n And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark\n Illumin, what is low raise and support;\n That to the highth of this great Argument\n I may assert Eternal Providence,\n And justifie the wayes of God to men.\n\n Say first, for Heav'n hides nothing from thy view\n Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause\n Mov'd our Grand Parents in that happy State,\n Favour'd of Heav'n so highly, to fall off\n From thir Creator, and transgress his Will\n For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?\n Who first seduc'd them to that foul revolt?\n Th' infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile\n Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv'd\n The Mother of Mankind, what time his Pride\n Had cast him out from Heav'n, with all his Host\n Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring\n To set himself in Glory above his Peers,\n He trusted to have equal'd the most High,\n If he oppos'd; and with ambitious aim\n Against the Throne and Monarchy of God\n Rais'd impious War in Heav'n and Battel proud\n With vain attempt.   Him the Almighty Power\n Hurld headlong flaming from th' Ethereal Skie\n With hideous ruine and combustion down\n To bottomless perdition, there to dwell\n In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,\n Who durst defie th' Omnipotent to Arms.\n Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night\n To mortal men, he with his horrid crew\n Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe\n Confounded though immortal: But his doom\n Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought\n Both of lost happiness and lasting pain\n Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes\n That witness'd huge affliction and dismay\n Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:\n At once as far as Angels kenn he views\n The dismal Situation waste and wilde,\n A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round\n As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames\n No light, but rather darkness visible\n Serv'd onely to discover sights of woe,\n Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace\n And rest can never dwell, hope never comes\n That comes to all; but torture without end\n Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed\n With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd:\n Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'd\n For those rebellious, here thir prison ordained\n In utter darkness, and thir portion set\n As far remov'd from God and light of Heav'n\n As from the Center thrice to th' utmost Pole.\n O how unlike the place from whence they fell!\n There the companions of his fall, o'rewhelm'd\n With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,\n He soon discerns, and weltring by his side\n One next himself in power, and next in crime,\n Long after known in Palestine, and nam'd\nBeelzebub.   To whom th' Arch-Enemy,\n And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold words\n Breaking the horrid silence thus began.\n\n If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd\n From him, who in the happy Realms of Light\n Cloth'd with transcendent brightness didst out-shine\n Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,\n United thoughts and counsels, equal hope\n And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,\n Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd\n In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest\n From what highth fall'n, so much the stronger prov'd\n He with his Thunder: and till then who knew\n The force of those dire Arms?   yet not for those,\n Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage\n Can else inflict, do I repent or change,\n Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind\n And high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit,\n That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend,\n And to the fierce contention brought along\n Innumerable force of Spirits arm'd\n That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,\n His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd\n In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,\n And shook his throne.   What though the field be lost?\n All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,\n And study of revenge, immortal hate,\n And courage never to submit or yield:\n And what is else not to be overcome?\n That Glory never shall his wrath or might\n Extort from me.   To bow and sue for grace\n With suppliant knee, and deifie his power,\n Who from the terrour of this Arm so late\n Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,\n That were an ignominy and shame beneath\n This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods\n And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,\n Since through experience of this great event\n In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,\n We may with more successful hope resolve\n To wage by force or guile eternal Warr\n Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,\n Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy\n Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n.\n\n So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain,\n Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:\n And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer.\n\n O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,\n That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr\n Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds\n Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;\n And put to proof his high Supremacy,\n Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,\n Too well I see and rue the dire event,\n That with sad overthrow and foul defeat\n Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host\n In horrible destruction laid thus low,\n As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences\n Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains\n Invincible, and vigour soon returns,\n Though all our Glory extinct and happy state\n Here swallow'd up in endless misery.\n But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now\n Of force believe Almighty, since no less\n Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours)\n Have left us this our spirit and strength intire\n Strongly to suffer and support our pains,\n That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,\n Or do him mightier service as his thralls\n By right of Warr, what e're his business be\n Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,\n Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;\n What can it then avail though yet we feel\n Strength undiminisht, or eternal being\n To undergo eternal punishment?\n Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd.\n\n Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable\n Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,\n To do ought good never will be our task,\n But ever to do ill our sole delight,\n As being the contrary to his high will\n Whom we resist.   If then his Providence\n Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,\n Our labour must be to pervert that end,\n And out of good still to find means of evil;\n Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps\n Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb\n His inmost counsels from thir destind aim.\n But see the angry Victor hath recall'd\n His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit\n Back to the Gates of Heav'n: the Sulphurous Hail\n Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid\n The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice\n Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder,\n Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage,\n Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now\n To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.\n Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn,\n Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.\n Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,\n The seat of desolation, voyd of light,\n Save what the glimmering of these livid flames\n Casts pale and dreadful?   Thither let us tend\n From off the tossing of these fiery waves,\n There rest, if any rest can harbour there,\n And reassembling our afflicted Powers,\n Consult how we may henceforth most offend\n Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,\n How overcome this dire Calamity,\n What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,\n If not what resolution from despare.\n\n Thus Satan to his neerest Mate\n With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes\n That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides\n Prone on the Flood, extended long and large\n Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge\n As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,\nTitanian, or Earth-born, that warr'd on Jove,\nBriareos or Typhon, whom the Den\n By ancient Tarsus held, or that Sea-beast\nLeviathan, which God of all his works\n Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream:\n Him haply slumbring on the Norway foam\n The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff,\n Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,\n With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind\n Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night\n Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:\n So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay\n Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence\n Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will\n And high permission of all-ruling Heaven\n Left him at large to his own dark designs,\n That with reiterated crimes he might\n Heap on himself damnation, while he sought\n Evil to others, and enrag'd might see\n How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth\n Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn\n On Man by him seduc't, but on himself\n Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.\n Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool\n His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames\n Drivn backward slope thir pointing spires, and rowld\n In billows, leave i'th'midst a horrid Vale.\n Then with expanded wings he stears his flight\n Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air\n That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land\n He lights, as if it were Land that ever burn'd\n With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;\n And such appear'd in hue, as when the force\n Of subterranean wind transports a Hill\n Torn from Pelorus, or the shatter'd side\n Of thundring Aetna, whose combustible\n And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire,\n Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,\n And leave a singed bottom all involv'd\n With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole\n Of unblest feet.   Him followed his next Mate,\n Both glorying to have scap't the Stygian flood\n As Gods, and by thir own recover'd strength,\n Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.\n\n Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,\n Said then the lost Arch-Angel, this the seat\n That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom\n For that celestial light?   Be it so, since he\n Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid\n What shall be right: fardest from him his best\n Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream\n Above his equals.   Farewel happy Fields\n Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail\n Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell\n Receive thy new Possessor:   One who brings\n A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.\n The mind is its own place, and in it self\n Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.\n What matter where, if I be still the same,\n And what I should be, all but less then he\n Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least\n We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built\n Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:\n Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce\n To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:\n Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n.\n But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,\n Th' associates and copartners of our loss\n Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool,\n And call them not to share with us their part\n In this unhappy Mansion, or once more\n With rallied Arms to try what may be yet\n Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell?\n\n So Satan spake, and him Beelzebub\n Thus answer'd.   Leader of those Armies bright,\n Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld,\n If once they hear that voyce, thir liveliest pledge\n Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft\n In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge\n Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults\n Thir surest signal, they will soon resume\n New courage and revive, though now they lye\n Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,\n As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd,\n No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth.\n\n He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend\n Was moving toward the shoar; his ponderous shield\n Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,\n Behind him cast; the broad circumference\n Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb\n Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views\n At Ev'ning from the top of Fesole,\n Or in Valdarno, to descry new Lands,\n Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.\n His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine\n Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast\n Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,\n He walkt with to support uneasie steps\n Over the burning Marle, not like those steps\n On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime\n Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;\n Nathless he so endur'd, till on the Beach\n Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd\n His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't\n Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks\n In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades\n High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge\n Afloat, when with fierce Winds Orion arm'd\n Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew\nBusirus and his Memphian Chivalry,\n While with perfidious hatred they pursu'd\n The Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld\n From the safe shore thir floating Carkases\n And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown\n Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,\n Under amazement of thir hideous change.\n He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep\n Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates\n Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost,\n If such astonishment as this can sieze\n Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place\n After the toyl of Battel to repose\n Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find\n To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n?\n Or in this abject posture have ye sworn\n To adore the Conquerour?   who now beholds\n Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood\n With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon\n His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern\n Th' advantage, and descending tread us down\n Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts\n Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.\n Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n.\n\n They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung\n Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch\n On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,\n Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.\n Nor did they not perceave the evil plight\n In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;\n Yet to thir Generals Voyce they soon obeyd\n Innumerable.   As when the potent Rod\n Of Amrams Son in Egypts evill day\n Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud\n Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind,\n That ore the Realm of impious Pharaoh hung\n Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of Nile:\n So numberless were those bad Angels seen\n Hovering on wind under the Cope of Hell\n 'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;\n Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear\n Of thir great Sultan waving to direct\n Thir course, in even ballance down they light\n On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;\n A multitude, like which the populous North\n Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass\nRhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons\n Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread\n Beneath Gibralter to the Lybian sands.\n Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band\n The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood\n Thir great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms\n Excelling human, Princely Dignities,\n And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;\n Though of thir Names in heav'nly Records now\n Be no memorial blotted out and ras'd\n By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.\n Nor had they yet among the Sons of Eve\n Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,\n Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,\n By falsities and lyes the greatest part\n Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake\n God thir Creator, and th' invisible\n Glory of him that made them, to transform\n Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd\n With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,\n And Devils to adore for Deities:\n Then were they known to men by various Names,\n And various Idols through the Heathen World.\n Say, Muse, the Names then known, who first, who last,\n Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,\n At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth\n Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,\n While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?\n The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell\n Roaming to seek thir prey on earth, durst fix\n Thir Seats long after next the Seat of God,\n Thir Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd\n Among the Nations round, and durst abide\nJehovah thundring out of Sion, thron'd\n Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd\n Within his Sanctuary it self thir Shrines,\n Abominations; and with cursed things\n His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd,\n And with thir darkness durst affront his light.\n First Moloch, horrid King besmear'd with blood\n Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,\n Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud\n Thir childrens cries unheard, that past through fire\n To his grim Idol.   Him the Ammonite\n Worshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain,\n In Argob and in Basan, to the stream\n Of utmost Arnon.   Not content with such\n Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart\n Of Solomon he led by fraud to build\n His Temple right against the Temple of God\n On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove\n The pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thence\n And black Gehenna call'd, the Type of Hell.\n Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moabs Sons,\n From Aroar to Nebo, and the wild\n Of Southmost Abarim; in Hesebon\n And Heronaim, Seons Realm, beyond\n The flowry Dale of Sibma clad with Vines,\n And Eleale to th' Asphaltick Pool.\nPeor his other Name, when he entic'd\nIsrael in Sittim on thir march from Nile\n To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.\n Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd\n Even to that Hill of scandal, but the Grove\n Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate;\n Till good Josiah drove them hence to Hell.\n With these cam they, who from the bordring flood\n Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts\nEgypt from Syrian ground, had general names\n Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male,\n These Feminine.   For Spirits when they please\n Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft\n And uncompounded is thir Essence pure,\n Nor ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb,\n Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,\n Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose\n Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure,\n Can execute thir aerie purposes,\n And works of love or enmity fulfill.\n For those the Race of Israel oft forsook\n Thir living strength, and unfrequented left\n His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down\n To bestial Gods; for which thir heads as low\n Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear\n Of despicable foes.   With these in troop\n Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians call'd\nAstarte, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;\n To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon\nSidonian Virgins paid thir Vows and Songs,\n In Sion also not unsung, where stood\n Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built\n By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,\n Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell\n To idols foul.   Thammuz came next behind,\n Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur'd\n The Syrian Damsels to lament his fate\n In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,\n While smooth Adonis from his native Rock\n Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood\n Of Thammuz yearly wounded; the Love-tale\n Infected Sions daughters with like heat,\n Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch\nEzekial saw, when by the Vision led\n His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries\n Of alienated Judah.   Next came one\n Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark\n Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off\n In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,\n Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers:\nDagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man\n And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high\n Rear'd in Azotus, dreaded through the Coast\n Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon\n And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds.\n Him follow'd Rimmon, whose delightful Seat\n Was fair Damascus, on the fertil Banks\n Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.\n He also against the house of God was bold:\n A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King,\nAhaz his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew\n Gods Altar to disparage and displace\n For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn\n His odious offrings, and adore the Gods\n Whom he had vanquisht.   After these appear'd\n A crew who under Names of old Renown,\nOsiris, Isis, Orus and thir Train\n With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd\n Fanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek\n Thir wandring Gods Disguis'd in brutish forms\n Rather then human.   Nor did Israel scape\n Th' infection when thir borrow'd Gold compos'd\n The Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King\n Doubl'd that sin in Bethel and in Dan,\n Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,\nJehovah, who in one Night when he pass'd\n From Egypt marching, equal'd with one stroke\n Both her first born and all her bleating Gods\nBelial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd\n Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love\n Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood\n Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee\n In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest\n Turns Atheist, as did Ely's Sons, who fill'd\n With lust and violence the house of God.\n In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns\n And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse\n Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,\n And injury and outrage: And when Night\n Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons\n Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.\n Witness the Streets of Sodom, and that night\n In Gibeah, when the hospitable door\n Expos'd a Matron to avoid worse rape.\n These were the prime in order and in might;\n The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,\n Th' Ionian Gods, of Javans issue held\n Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth\n Thir boasted Parents; Titan Heav'ns first born\n With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd\n By younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove\n His own and Rhea's Son like measure found;\n So Jove usurping reign'd: these first in Creet\n And Ida known, thence on the Snowy top\n Of cold Olympus rul'd the middle Air\n Thir highest Heav'n; or on the Delphian Cliff,\n Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds\n Of Doric Land; or who with Saturn old\n Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian Fields,\n And ore the Celtic roam'd the utmost Isles.\n All these and more came flocking; but with looks\n Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd\n Obscure some glimps of joy, to have found thir chief\n Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost\n In loss itself; which on his count'nance cast\n Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride\n Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore\n Semblance of worth, not substance, gently rais'd\n Thir fanting courage, and dispel'd thir fears.\n Then strait commands that at the warlike sound\n Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard\n His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd\nAzazel as his right, a Cherube tall:\n Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld\n Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't\n Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind\n With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd,\n Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while\n Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:\n At which the universal Host upsent\n A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond\n Frighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night.\n All in a moment through the gloom were seen\n Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air\n With Orient Colours waving: with them rose\n A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms\n Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array\n Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move\n In perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood\n Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd\n To hight of noblest temper Hero's old\n Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage\n Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd\n With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,\n Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage\n With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase\n Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain\n From mortal or immortal minds.   Thus they\n Breathing united force with fixed thought\n Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd\n Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now\n Advanc't in view, they stand, a horrid Front\n Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise\n Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield,\n Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief\n Had to impose: He through the armed Files\n Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse\n The whole Battalion views, thir order due,\n Thir visages and stature as of Gods,\n Thir number last he summs.   And now his heart\n Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength\n Glories: For never since created man,\n Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these\n Could merit more then that small infantry\n Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood\n Of Phlegra with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd\n That fought at Theb's and Ilium, on each side\n Mixt with auxiliar Gods;   and what resounds\n In Fable or Romance of Uthers Sons\n Begirt with British and Armoric Knights;\n And all who since Baptiz'd or Infidel\n Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban,\nDamasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond\n Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore\n When Charlemain with all his Peerage fell\n By Fontarabbia.   Thus far these beyond\n Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd\n Thir dread commander: he above the rest\n In shape and gesture proudly eminent\n Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost\n All her Original brightness, nor appear'd\n Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess\n Of Glory obscur'd;   As when the Sun new ris'n\n Looks through the Horizontal misty Air\n Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon\n In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds\n On half the Nations, and with fear of change\n Perplexes Monarch.   Dark'n'd so, yet shon\n Above them all th' Arch Angel; but his face\n Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care\n Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes\n Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride\n Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast\n Signs of remorse and passion to behold\n The fellows of his crime, the followers rather\n (Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd\n For ever now to have thir lot in pain,\n Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't\n Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung\n For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,\n Thir Glory witherd.   As when Heavens Fire\n Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,\n With singed top thir stately growth though bare\n Stands on the blasted Heath.   He now prepar'd\n To speak; whereat thir doubl'd Ranks they bend\n From wing to wing, and half enclose him round\n With all his Peers: attention held them mute.\n Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spight of scorn,\n Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last\n Words interwove with sighs found out thir way.\n\n O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers\n Matchless, but with th' Almighty, and that strife\n Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire,\n As this place testifies, and this dire change\n Hateful to utter: but what power of mind\n Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth\n Of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd,\n How such united force of Gods, how such\n As stood like these, could ever know repulse?\n For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,\n That all these puissant Legions, whose exile\n Hath emptied Heav'n, shall fail to re-ascend\n Self-rais'd, and repossess thir native seat?\n For mee be witness all the Host of Heav'n,\n If counsels different, or danger shun'd\n By mee, have lost our hopes.   But he who reigns\n Monarch in Heav'n, till then as one secure\n Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,\n Consent or custome, and his Regal State\n Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd,\n Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.\n Henceforth his might we know, and know our own\n So as not either to provoke, or dread\n New warr, provok't; our better part remains\n To work in close design, by fraud or guile\n What force effected not: that he no less\n At length from us may find, who overcomes\n By force, hath overcome but half his foe.\n Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife\n There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere long\n Intended to create, and therein plant\n A generation, whom his choice regard\n Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:\n Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps\n Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:\n For this Infernal Pit shall never hold\n Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abyss\n Long under darkness cover.   But these thoughts\n Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,\n For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr\n Open or understood must be resolv'd.\n\n He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew\n Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs\n Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze\n Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd\n Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped Arms\n Clash'd on thir sounding Shields the din of war,\n Hurling defiance toward the Vault of Heav'n.\n\n There stood a hill not far whose griesly top\n Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire\n Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign\n That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,\n The work of Sulphur.   Thither wing'd with speed\n A numerous Brigad hasten'd.   As when Bands\n Of Pioners with Spade and Pickax arm'd\n Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,\n Or cast a Rampart.   Mammon led them on,\nMammon, the least erected Spirit that fell\n From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks and thoughts\n Were always downward bent, admiring more\n The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold,\n Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd\n In vision beatific: by him first\n Men also, and by his suggestion taught\n Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands\n Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth\n For Treasures better hid.   Soon had his crew\n Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound\n And dig'd out ribs of Gold.   Let none admire\n That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best\n Deserve the precious bane.   And here let those\n Who boast in mortal things, and wond'ring tell\n Of Babel, and the works of Memphian Kings\n Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,\n And Strength and Art are easily out-done\n By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour\n What in an age they with incessant toyle\n And hands innumerable scarce perform.\n Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd\n That underneath had veins of liquid fire\n Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude\n With wond'rous Art found out the massie Ore,\n Severing each kind, and scum'd the Bullion dross:\n A third as soon had form'd within the ground\n A various mould, and from the boyling cells\n By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook,\n As in an Organ from one blast of wind\n To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.\n Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge\n Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound\n Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,\n Built like a Temple, where Pilasters round\n Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid\n With Golden Architrave; nor did there want\n Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n,\n The Roof was fretted Gold.   Not Babilon,\n Nor great Alcairo such magnificence\n Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine\nBelus or Serapis thir Gods, or seat\n Thir Kings, when Aegypt with Assyria strove\n In wealth and luxurie.   Th' ascending pile\n Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores\n Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide\n Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth\n And level pavement: from the arched roof\n Pendant by suttle Magic many a row\n Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed\n With Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded light\n As from a sky.   The hasty multitude\n Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise\n And some the Architect: his hand was known\n In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high,\n Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence,\n And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King\n Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,\n Each in his Hierarchie, the Orders bright.\n Nor was his name unheard or unador'd\n In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land\n Men call'd him Mulciber; and how he fell\n From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry Jove\n Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements; from Morn\n To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,\n A Summers day; and with the setting Sun\n Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,\n On Lemnos th' Aegaean Ile: thus they relate,\n Erring; for he with this rebellious rout\n Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now\n To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape\n By all his Engins, but was headlong sent\n With his industrious crew to build in hell.\n Mean while the winged Haralds by command\n Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony\n And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim\n A solemn Councel forthwith to be held\n At Pandaemonium, the high Capital\n Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd\n From every Band and squared Regiment\n By place or choice the worthiest; they anon\n With hunderds and with thousands trooping came\n Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates\n And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall\n (Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold\n Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair\n Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry\n To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)\n Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air,\n Brusht with the hiss of russling wings.   As Bees\n In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,\n Pour forth thir populous youth about the Hive\n In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers\n Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,\n The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,\n New rub'd with Baum, expatiate and confer\n Thir State affairs.   So thick the aerie crowd\n Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n\n Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd\n In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons\n Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room\n Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race\n Beyond the Indian Mount, or Faerie Elves,\n Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side\n Or Fountain some belated Peasant sees,\n Or dreams he sees, while over-head the Moon\n Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth\n Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth and dance\n Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;\n At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.\n Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms\n Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large,\n Though without number still amidst the Hall\n Of that infernal Court.   But far within\n And in thir own dimensions like themselves\n The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim\n In close recess and secret conclave sat\n A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat's,\n Frequent and full.   After short silence then\n And summons read, the great consult began.",
        "Paradise Lost: Book  7 (1674 version)": "DEscend from Heav'n Urania, by that name If rightly thou art call'd, whose Voice divine Following, above th' Olympian Hill I soare, Above the flight of Pegasean wing. The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top Of old Olympus dwell'st, but Heav'nlie borne, Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow'd, Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse, Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play In presence of th' Almightie Father, pleas'd With thy Celestial Song.   Up led by thee Into the Heav'n of Heav'ns I have presum'd, An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire, Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down Return me to my Native Element: Least from this flying Steed unrein'd, (as once Bellerophon, though from a lower Clime) Dismounted, on th' Aleian Field I fall Erroneous there to wander and forlorne. Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound Within the visible Diurnal Spheare; Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole, More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang'd To hoarce or mute, though fall'n on evil dayes, On evil dayes though fall'n, and evil tongues; In darkness, and with dangers compast round, And solitude; yet not alone, while thou Visit'st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn Purples the East: still govern thou my Song, Urania, and fit audience find, though few. But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance Of Bacchus and his revellers, the Race Of that wilde Rout that tore the Thracian Bard In Rhodope, where Woods and Rocks had Eares To rapture, till the savage clamor dround Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend Her Son.   So fail not thou, who thee implores: For thou are Heav'nlie, shee an emptie dreame.  Say Goddess, what ensu'd when Raphael, The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarn'd Adam by dire example to beware Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven To those Apostates, least the like befall In Paradise to Adam or his Race, Charg'd not to touch the interdicted Tree, If they transgress, and slight that sole command, So easily obeyd amid the choice Of all tastes else to please thir appetite, Though wandring.   He with his consorted Eve The storie heard attentive, and was fill'd With admiration, and deep Muse to hear Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought So unimaginable as hate in Heav'n, And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss With such confusion: but the evil soon Driv'n back redounded as a flood on those From whom it sprung, impossible to mix With Blessedness.   Whence Adam soon repeal'd The doubts that in his heart arose: and now Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know What neerer might concern him, how this World Of Heav'n and Earth conspicious first began, When, and whereof created, for what cause, What within Eden or without was done Before his memorie, as one whose drouth Yet scarce allay'd still eyes the current streame, Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, Proceeded thus to ask his Heav'nly Guest.  Great things, and full of wonder in our eares, Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal'd Divine interpreter, by favour sent Down from the Empyrean to forewarne Us timely of what might else have bin our loss, Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach: For which to the infinitly Good we owe Immortal thanks, and his admonishment Receave with solemne purpose to observe Immutably his sovran will, the end Of what we are.   But since thou hast voutsaf't Gently for our instruction to impart Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd, Deign to descend now lower, and relate What may no less perhaps availe us known, How first began this Heav'n which we behold Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus'd Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause Mov'd the Creator in his holy Rest Through all Eternitie so late to build In Chaos, and the work begun, how soon Absolv'd, if unforbid thou maist unfould What wee, not to explore the secrets aske Of his Eternal Empire, but the more To magnifie his works, the more we know. And the great Light of Day yet wants to run Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav'n Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares, And longer will delay to heare thee tell His Generation, and the rising Birth Of Nature from the unapparent Deep: Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch, Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine.  Thus Adam his illustrious Guest besought:  And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde. This also thy request with caution askt Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, Or heart of man suffice to comprehend? Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve To glorifie the Maker, and inferr Thee also happier, shall not be withheld Thy hearing, such Commission from above I have receav'd, to answer thy desire Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope Things not reveal'd, which th' invisible King, Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night, To none communicable in Earth or Heaven: Anough is left besides to search and know. But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less Her Temperance over Appetite, to know In measure what the mind may well contain, Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde.  Know then, that after Lucifer from Heav'n (So call him, brighter once amidst the Host Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among) Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep Into his place, and the great Son returnd Victorious with his Saints, th' Omnipotent Eternal Father from his Throne beheld Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake.  At least our envious Foe hath fail'd, who thought All like himself rebellious, by whose aid This inaccessible high strength, the seat Of Deitie supream, us dispossest, He trusted to have seis'd, and into fraud Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more; Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see, Thir station, Heav'n yet populous retaines Number sufficient to possess her Realmes Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent With Ministeries due and solemn Rites: But least his heart exalt him in the harme Already done, to have dispeopl'd Heav'n My damage fondly deem'd, I can repaire That detriment, if such it be to lose Self-lost, and in a moment will create Another World, out of one man a Race Of men innumerable, there to dwell, Not here, till by degrees of merit rais'd They open to themselves at length the way Up hither, under long obedience tri'd, And Earth be chang'd to Heav'n, & Heav'n to Earth, One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end. Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav'n, And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee This I perform, speak thou, and be it don: My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep Within appointed bounds be Heav'n and Earth, Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. Though I uncircumscrib'd my self retire, And put not forth my goodness, which is free To act or not, Necessitie and Chance Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate.  So spake th' Almightie, and to what he spake His Word, the filial Godhead, gave effect. Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift Then time or motion, but to human ears Cannot without process of speech be told, So told as earthly notion can receave. Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav'n When such was heard declar'd the Almightie's will; Glorie they sung to the most High, good will To future men, and in thir dwellings peace: Glorie to him whose just avenging ire Had driven out th' ungodly from his sight And th' habitations of the just; to him Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd Good out of evil to create, in stead Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse His good to Worlds and Ages infinite. So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son On his great Expedition now appeer'd, Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown'd Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love Immense, and all his Father in him shon. About his Chariot numberless were pour'd Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones, And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing'd, From the Armoury of God, where stand of old Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd Against a solemn day, harnest at hand, Celestial Equipage; and now came forth Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd, Attendant on thir Lord: Heav'n op'nd wide Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound On golden Hinges moving, to let forth The King of Glorie in his powerful Word And Spirit coming to create new Worlds. On heav'nly ground they stood, and from the shore They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, Up from the bottom turn'd by furious windes And surging waves, as Mountains to assault Heav'ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole.  Silence, ye troubl'd waves, and thou Deep, peace, Said then th' Omnific Word, your discord end: Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode Farr into Chaos, and the World unborn; For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Traine Follow'd in bright procession to behold Creation, and the wonders of his might. Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand He took the golden Compasses, prepar'd In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe This Universe, and all created things: One foot he center'd, and the other turn'd Round through the vast profunditie obscure, And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds, This be thy just Circumference, O World. Thus God the Heav'n created, thus the Earth, Matter unform'd and void: Darkness profound Cover'd th' Abyss: but on the watrie calme His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred, And vital vertue infus'd, and vital warmth Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg'd The black tartareous cold Infernal dregs Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd Like things to like, the rest to several place Disparted, and between spun out the Air, And Earth self ballanc't on her Center hung.  Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East To journie through the airie gloom began, Sphear'd in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle Sojourn'd the while.   God saw the Light was good; And light from darkness by the Hemisphere Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night He nam'd.   Thus was the first Day Eev'n and Morn: Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld; Birth-day of Heav'n and Earth; with joy and shout The hollow Universal Orb they fill'd, And touch't thir Golden Harps, and hymning prais'd God and his works, Creatour him they sung, Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn.  Again, God said, let ther be Firmament Amid the Waters, and let it divide The Waters from the Waters: and God made The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd In circuit to the uttermost convex Of this great Round: partition firm and sure, The Waters underneath from those above Dividing: for as Earth, so he the World Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule Of Chaos farr remov'd, least fierce extreames Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n And Morning Chorus sung the second Day.  The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd, Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warme Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe, Fermented the great Mother to conceave, Satiate with genial moisture, when God said Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n Into one place, and let dry Land appeer. Immediately the Mountains huge appeer Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie: So high as heav'd the tumid Hills, so low Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, Capacious bed of Waters: thither they Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld As drops on dust conglobing from the drie; Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct, For haste; such flight the great command impress'd On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard) Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng, Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found, If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine, Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill, But they, or under ground, or circuit wide With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way, And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore; Easie, e're God had bid the ground be drie, All but within those banks, where Rivers now Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine. The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle Of congregated Waters he call'd Seas: And saw that it was good, and said, Let th' Earth Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yielding Seed, And Fruit Tree yielding Fruit after her kind; Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth. He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd, Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad Her Universal Face with pleasant green, Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed Embattell'd in her field: and the humble Shrub, And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd Thir blossoms: with high woods the hills were crownd, With tufts the vallies and each fountain side, With borders long the Rivers.   That Earth now Seemd like to Heav'n, a seat where Gods might dwell, Or wander with delight, and love to haunt Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain'd Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist Went up and waterd all the ground, and each Plant of the field, which e're it was in the Earth God made, and every Herb, before it grew On the green stemm; God saw that it was good. So Eev'n and Morn recorded the Third Day.  Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes, For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years, And let them be for Lights as I ordaine Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n To give Light on the Earth; and it was so. And God made two great Lights, great for thir use To Man, the greater to have rule by Day, The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs, And set them in the Firmament of Heav'n To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night, And Light from Darkness to divide.   God saw, Surveying his great Work, that it was good: For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first, Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon Globose, and every magnitude of Starrs, And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field: Of Light by farr the greater part he took, Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light. Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light, And hence the Morning Planet guilds her horns; By tincture or reflection they augment Thir small peculiar, though from human sight So farr remote, with diminution seen. First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen, Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run His Longitude through Heav'ns high rode: the gray Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danc'd Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon, But opposite in leveld West was set His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light From him, for other light she needed none In that aspect, and still that distance keepes Till night, then in the East her turn she shines, Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds, With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose, Glad Eevning and glad Morn crownd the fourth day.  And God said, let the Waters generate Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule: And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n. And God created the great Whales, and each Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously The waters generated by thir kindes, And every Bird of wing after his kinde; And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying, Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill; And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth. Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek and Bay With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, and through Groves Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance Show to the Sun thir wav'd coats dropt with Gold, Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale, And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes, And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea. Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos'd Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge They summ'd thir Penns, and soaring th' air sublime With clang despis'd the ground, under a cloud In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build: Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise In common, rang'd in figure wedge thir way, Intelligent of seasons, and set forth Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea's Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire Floats, as they pass, fann'd with unnumber'd plumes: From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song So1ac'd the Woods, and spred thir painted wings Till Ev'n, nor then the solemn Nightingal Ceas'd warbling, but all night tun'd her soft layes: Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath'd Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground Walk'd firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds The silent hours, and th' other whose gay Traine Adorns him, colour'd with the Florid hue Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes.   The Waters thus With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle, Ev'ning and Morn solemniz'd the Fift day.  The Sixt, and of Creation last arose With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said, Let th' Earth bring forth Foul living in her kinde, Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth, Each in their kinde.   The Earth obey'd, and strait Op'ning her fertil Woomb teem'd at a Birth Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes, Limb'd and full grown: out of the ground up rose As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den; Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk'd: The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green: Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung. The grassie Clods now Calv'd, now half appeer'd The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds, And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce, The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale Rising, the crumbl'd Earth above them threw In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav'd His vastness: Fleec't the Flocks and bleating rose, As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land The River Horse and scalie Crocodile. At once came forth whatever creeps the ground, Insect or Worme; those wav'd thir limber fans For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green: These as a line thir long dimension drew, Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde Wondrous in length and corpulence involv'd Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings.   First crept The Parsimonious Emmet, provident Of future, in small room large heart enclos'd, Pattern of just equalitie perhaps Hereafter, join'd in her popular Tribes Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer'd The Female Bee that feeds her Husband Drone Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells With Honey stor'd: the rest are numberless, And thou thir Natures know'st, & gav'st them Names, Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown The Serpent suttl'st Beast of all the field, Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes And hairie Main terrific, though to thee Not noxious, but obedient at thy call. Now Heav'n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld Her motions, as the great first Movers hand First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire Consummate lovly smil'd; Aire, Water, Earth, By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain'd; There wanted yet the Master work, the end Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone And Brute as other Creatures, but endu'd With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect His Stature, and upright with Front serene Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence Magnanimous to correspond with Heav'n, But grateful to acknowledge whence his good Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes Directed in Devotion, to adore And worship God Supream, who made him chief Of all his works; therefore the Omnipotent Eternal Father (For where is not hee Present) thus to his Son audibly spake.  Let us make now Man in our image, Man In our similitude, and let them rule Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire, Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth, And every creeping thing that creeps the ground. This said, he formd thee, Adam, thee O Man Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath'd The breath of Life; in his own Image hee Created thee, in the Image of God Express, and thou becam'st a living Soul. Male he created thee, but thy consort Female for Race; then bless'd Mankinde, and said, Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth, Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire, And every living thing that moves on the Earth. Wherever thus created, for no place Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knows't He brought thee into this delicious Grove, This Garden, planted with the Trees of God, Delectable both to behold and taste; And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th' Earth yields, Varietie without end; but of the Tree Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil, Thou mai'st not; in the day thou eat'st, thou di'st; Death is the penaltie impos'd, beware, And govern well thy appetite, least sin Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. Here finish'd hee, and all that he had made View'd, and behold all was entirely good; So Ev'n and Morn accomplish'd the Sixt day: Yet not till the Creator from his work Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd Up to the Heav'n of Heav'ns his high abode, Thence to behold this new created World Th' addition of his Empire, how it shew'd In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire, Answering his great Idea.   Up he rode Followd with acclamation and the sound Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun'd Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire Resounded, (thou remember'st, for thou heardst) The Heav'ns and all the Constellations rung, The Planets in thir station list'ning stood, While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant. Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung, Open, ye Heav'ns, your living dores; let in The great Creator from his work returnd Magnificent, his Six days work, a World; Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne To visit oft the dwellings of just Men Delighted, and with frequent intercourse Thither will send his winged Messengers On errands of supernal Grace.   So sung The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav'n, That open'd wide her blazing Portals, led To Gods Eternal house direct the way, A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer, Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest Pouderd with Starrs.   And now on Earth the Seventh Eev'ning arose in Eden, for the Sun Was set, and twilight from the East came on, Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount Of Heav'ns high-seated top, th' Impereal Throne Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure, The Filial Power arriv'd, and sate him down With his great Father (for he also went Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain'd, Author and end of all things, and from work Now resting, bless'd and hallowd the Seav'nth day, As resting on that day from all his work, But not in silence holy kept; the Harp Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe, And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop, All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire Temper'd sort Tunings, intermixt with Voice Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount. Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung, Great are thy works, Jehovah, infinite Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue Relate thee; greater now in thy return Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day Thy Thunders magnifi'd; but to create Is greater then created to destroy. Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw The number of thy worshippers.   Who seekes To lessen thee, against his purpose serves To manifest the more thy might: his evil Thou usest, and from thence creat'st more good. Witness this new-made World, another Heav'n From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view On the cleer Hyaline, the Glassie Sea; Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr's Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World Of destind habitation; but thou know'st Thir seasons: among these the seat of men, Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus'd, Thir pleasant dwelling place.   Thrice happie men, And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc't, Created in his Image, there to dwell And worship him, and in reward to rule Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air, And multiply a Race of Worshippers Holy and just: thrice happie if they know Thir happiness, and persevere upright. So sung they, and the Empyrean rung, With Halleluiahs: Thus was Sabbath kept. And thy request think now fulfill'd, that ask'd How first this World and face of things began, And what before thy memorie was don From the beginning, that posteritie Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.",
        "Paradise Lost: Book  9 (1674 version)": "NO more of talk where God or Angel Guest\n With Man, as with his Friend, familiar us'd\n To sit indulgent, and with him partake\n Rural repast, permitting him the while\n Venial discourse unblam'd: I now must change\n Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach\n Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt,\n And disobedience: On the part of Heav'n\n Now alienated, distance and distaste,\n Anger and just rebuke, and judgement giv'n,\n That brought into this World a world of woe,\n Sinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie\n Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument\n Not less but more Heroic then the wrauth\n Of stern Achilles on his Foe pursu'd\n Thrice Fugitive about Troy Wall; or rage\n Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'd,\n Or Neptun's ire or Juno's, that so long\n Perplex'd the Greek and Cytherea's Son;\n If answerable style I can obtaine\n Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes\n Her nightly visitation unimplor'd,\n And dictates to me slumbring, or inspires\n Easie my unpremeditated Verse:\n Since first this Subject for Heroic Song\n Pleas'd me long choosing, and beginning late;\n Not sedulous by Nature to indite\n Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument\n Heroic deem'd, chief maistrie to dissect\n With long and tedious havoc fabl'd Knights\n In Battels feign'd; the better fortitude\n Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom\n Unsung; or to describe Races and Games,\n Or tilting Furniture, emblazon'd Shields,\n Impreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds;\n Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights\n At Joust and Torneament; then marshal'd Feast\n Serv'd up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals;\n The skill of Artifice or Office mean,\n Not that which justly gives Heroic name\n To Person or to Poem.

There was a place,\n Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,\n Where Tigris at the foot of Paradise\n Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part\n Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;\n In with the River sunk, and with it rose\n Satan involv'd in rising Mist, then sought\n Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land\n From Eden over Pontus, and the Poole\nMaotis, up beyond the River Ob;\n Downward as farr Antartic; and in length\n West from Orontes to the Ocean barr'd\n At Darien, thence to the Land where flowes\nGanges and Indus: thus the Orb he roam'd\n With narrow search; and with inspection deep\n Consider'd every Creature, which of all\n Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found\n The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.\n Him after long debate, irresolute\n Of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose\n Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom\n To enter, and his dark suggestions hide\n From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,\n Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark,\n As from his wit and native suttletie\n Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ'd\n Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow'r\n Active within beyond the sense of brute.\n Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe\n His bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd:\n\n O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferr'd\n More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built\n With second thoughts, reforming what was old!\n For what God after better worse would build?\n Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns\n That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,\n Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,\n In thee concentring all thir precious beams\n Of sacred influence:   As God in Heav'n\n Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou\n Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee,\n Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers\n Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth\n Of Creatures animate with gradual life\n Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man.\n With what delight could I have walkt thee round,\n If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange\n Of Hill, and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,\n Now Land, now Sea, and Shores with Forrest crownd,\n Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these\n Find place or refuge; and the more I see\n Pleasures about me, so much more I feel\n Torment within me, as from the hateful siege\n Of contraries; all good to me becomes\n Bane, and in Heav'n much worse would be my state.\n But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n\n To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame;\n Nor hope to be my self less miserable\n By what I seek, but others to make such\n As I, though thereby worse to me redound:\n For onely in destroying I find ease\n To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,\n Or won to what may work his utter loss,\n For whom all this was made, all this will soon\n Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,\n In wo then; that destruction wide may range:\n To mee shall be the glorie sole among\n The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd\n What he Almightie styl'd, six Nights and Days\n Continu'd making, and who knows how long\n Before had bin contriving, though perhaps\n Not longer then since I in one Night freed\n From servitude inglorious welnigh half\n Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng\n Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd,\n And to repaire his numbers thus impair'd,\n Whether such vertue spent of old now faild\n More Angels to Create, if they at least\n Are his Created, or to spite us more,\n Determin'd to advance into our room\n A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow,\n Exalted from so base original,\n With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed\n He effected; Man he made, and for him built\n Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,\n Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie!\n Subjected to his service Angel wings,\n And flaming Ministers to watch and tend\n Thir earthy Charge: Of these the vigilance\n I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist\n Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie\n In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde\n The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds\n To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.\n O foul descent! that I who erst contended\n With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind\n Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,\n This essence to incarnate and imbrute,\n That to the hight of Deitie aspir'd;\n But what will not Ambition and Revenge\n Descend to? who aspires must down as low\n As high he soard, obnoxious first or last\n To basest things.   Revenge, at first though sweet,\n Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles;\n Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd,\n Since higher I fall short, on him who next\n Provokes my envie, this new Favorite\n Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,\n Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd\n From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.\n\n So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,\n Like a black mist low creeping, he held on\n His midnight search, where soonest he might finde\n The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found\n In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowld,\n His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles:\n Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,\n Nor nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe\n Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth\n The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,\n In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd\n With act intelligential, but his sleep\n Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn.\n Now when as sacred Light began to dawne\n In Eden on the humid Flours, that breathd\n Thir morning incense, when all things that breath,\n From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise\n To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill\n With grateful Smell, forth came the human pair\n And joind thir vocal Worship to the Quire\n Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake\n The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:\n Then commune how that day they best may ply\n Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew\n The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.\n And Eve first to her Husband thus began.\n\nAdam, well may we labour still to dress\n This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour,\n Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands\n Aid us, the work under our labour grows,\n Luxurious by restraint; what we by day\n Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,\n One night or two with wanton growth derides\n Tending to wilde.   Thou therefore now advise\n Or hear what to my minde first thoughts present,\n Let us divide our labours, thou where choice\n Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind\n The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct\n The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I\n In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt\n With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:\n For while so near each other thus all day\n Our taske we choose, what wonder if so near\n Looks intervene and smiles, or object new\n Casual discourse draw on, which intermits\n Our dayes work brought to little, though begun\n Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd.\n\n To whom mild answer Adam thus return'd.\n Sole Eve, Associate sole, to me beyond\n Compare above all living Creatures deare,\n Well hast thou motion'd, well thy thoughts imployd\n How we might best fulfill the work which here\n God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass\n Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found\n In Woman, then to studie houshold good,\n And good workes in her Husband to promote.\n Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd\n Labour, as to debarr us when we need\n Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,\n Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse\n Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,\n To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food,\n Love not the lowest end of human life.\n For not to irksom toile, but to delight\n He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd.\n These paths & Bowers doubt not but our joynt hands\n Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide\n As we need walk, till younger hands ere long\n Assist us: But if much converse perhaps\n Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield.\n For solitude somtimes is best societie,\n And short retirement urges sweet returne.\n But other doubt possesses me, least harm\n Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst\n What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe\n Envying our happiness, and of his own\n Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame\n By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand\n Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find\n His wish and best advantage, us asunder,\n Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each\n To other speedie aide might lend at need;\n Whether his first design be to withdraw\n Our fealtie from God, or to disturb\n Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss\n Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more;\n Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side\n That gave thee being, still shades thee and protects.\n The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,\n Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies,\n Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.\n\n To whom the Virgin Majestie of Eve,\n As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,\n With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd,\n\n Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord,\n That such an Enemie we have, who seeks\n Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne,\n And from the parting Angel over-heard\n As in a shadie nook I stood behind,\n Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours.\n But that thou shouldst my firmness therfore doubt\n To God or thee, because we have a foe\n May tempt it, I expected not to hear.\n His violence thou fearst not, being such,\n As wee, not capable of death or paine,\n Can either not receave, or can repell.\n His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs\n Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love\n Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't;\n Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy brest\nAdam, missthought of her to thee so dear?\n\n To whom with healing words Adam replyd.\n Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve,\n For such thou art, from sin and blame entire:\n Not diffident of thee do I dissuade\n Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid\n Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe.\n For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses\n The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd\n Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff\n Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne\n And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong,\n Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,\n If such affront I labour to avert\n From thee alone, which on us both at once\n The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare,\n Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light.\n Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;\n Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce\n Angels, nor think superfluous others aid.\n I from the influence of thy looks receave\n Access in every Vertue, in thy sight\n More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were\n Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,\n Shame to be overcome or over-reacht\n Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite.\n Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel\n When I am present, and thy trial choose\n With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd.\n\n So spake domestick Adam in his care\n And Matrimonial Love; but Eve, who thought\n Less attributed to her Faith sincere,\n Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd.\n\n If this be our condition, thus to dwell\n In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe,\n Suttle or violent, we not endu'd\n Single with like defence, wherever met,\n How are we happie, still in fear of harm?\n But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe\n Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem\n Of our integritie: his foul esteeme\n Sticks no dishonour on our Front, but turns\n Foul on himself; then wherefore shund or feard\n By us? who rather double honour gaine\n From his surmise prov'd false, find peace within,\n Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event.\n And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid\n Alone, without exterior help sustaind?\n Let us not then suspect our happie State\n Left so imperfet by the Maker wise,\n As not secure to single or combin'd.\n Fraile is our happiness, if this be so,\n And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd.\n\n To whom thus Adam fervently repli'd.\n O Woman, best are all things as the will\n Of God ordain'd them, his creating hand\n Nothing imperfet or deficient left\n Of all that he Created, much less Man,\n Or aught that might his happie State secure,\n Secure from outward force; within himself\n The danger lies, yet lies within his power:\n Against his will he can receave no harme.\n But God left free the Will, for what obeyes\n Reason, is free, and Reason he made right,\n But bid her well beware, and still erect,\n Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd\n She dictate false, and misinforme the Will\n To do what God expressly hath forbid.\n Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes,\n That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.\n Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve,\n Since Reason not impossibly may meet\n Some specious object by the Foe subornd,\n And fall into deception unaware,\n Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd.\n Seek not temptation then, which to avoide\n Were better, and most likelie if from mee\n Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought.\n Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve\n First thy obedience; th' other who can know,\n Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?\n But if thou think, trial unsought may finde\n Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst,\n Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;\n Go in thy native innocence, relie\n On what thou hast of vertue, summon all,\n For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.\n So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve\n Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd.\n\n With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd\n Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words\n Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought,\n May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd,\n The willinger I goe, nor much expect\n A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek;\n So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.\n Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand\n Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light\nOread or Dryad, or of Delia's Traine,\n Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's self\n In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport,\n Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd,\n But with such Gardning Tools as Art yet rude,\n Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought.\n To Pales, or Pomona thus adornd,\n Likeliest she seemd, Pomona when she fled\nVertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime,\n Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove.\n Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu'd\n Delighted, but desiring more her stay.\n Oft he to her his charge of quick returne\n Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd\n To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre,\n And all things in best order to invite\n Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose.\n O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless Eve,\n Of thy presum'd return! event perverse!\n Thou never from that houre in Paradise\n Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose;\n Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades\n Waited with hellish rancour imminent\n To intercept thy way, or send thee back\n Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss.\n For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend,\n Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come,\n And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde\n The onely two of Mankinde, but in them\n The whole included Race, his purposd prey.\n In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft\n Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,\n Thir tendance or Plantation for delight,\n By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet\n He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find\nEve separate, he wish'd, but not with hope\n Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish,\n Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,\n Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood,\n Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round\n About her glowd, oft stooping to support\n Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay\n Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold,\n Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies\n Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while,\n Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour,\n From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh.\n Neerer he drew, and many a walk travers'd\n Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme,\n Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen\n Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours\n Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve:\n Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd\n Or of reviv'd Adonis, or renownd\nAlcinous, host of old Laertes Son,\n Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King\n Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse.\n Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more.\n As one who long in populous City pent,\n Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire,\n Forth issuing on a Summers Morn to breathe\n Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes\n Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight,\n The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,\n Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound;\n If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass,\n What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more,\n She most, and in her look summs all Delight.\n Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold\n This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve\n Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme\n Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine,\n Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire\n Of gesture or lest action overawd\n His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd\n His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:\n That space the Evil one abstracted stood\n From his own evil, and for the time remaind\n Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd,\n Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge;\n But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes,\n Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight,\n And tortures him now more, the more he sees\n Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon\n Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts\n Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.\n\n Thoughts, whither have ye led me, with what sweet\n Compulsion thus transported to forget\n What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope\n Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste\n Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,\n Save what is in destroying, other joy\n To me is lost.   Then let me not let pass\n Occasion which now smiles, behold alone\n The Woman, opportune to all attempts,\n Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh,\n Whose higher intellectual more I shun,\n And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb\n Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould,\n Foe not informidable, exempt from wound,\n I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine\n Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n.\n Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods,\n Not terrible, though terrour be in Love\n And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate,\n Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd,\n The way which to her ruin now I tend.\n\n So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd\n In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve\n Address'd his way, not with indented wave,\n Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare,\n Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd\n Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head\n Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;\n With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect\n Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass\n Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape,\n And lovely, never since of Serpent kind\n Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd\nHermione and Cadmus, or the God\n In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd\nAmmonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen,\n Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore\nScipio the highth of Rome.   With tract oblique\n At first, as one who sought access, but feard\n To interrupt, side-long he works his way.\n As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought\n Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind\n Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;\n So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine\n Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,\n To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound\n Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd\n To such disport before her through the Field,\n From every Beast, more duteous at her call,\n Then at Circean call the Herd disguis'd.\n Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood;\n But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd\n His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck,\n Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod.\n His gentle dumb expression turnd at length\n The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad\n Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue\n Organic, or impulse of vocal Air,\n His fraudulent temptation thus began.\n\n Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps\n Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm\n Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain,\n Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze\n Insatiate, I thus single, nor have feard\n Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd.\n Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire,\n Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine\n By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore\n With ravishment beheld, there best beheld\n Where universally admir'd; but here\n In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among,\n Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne\n Half what in thee is fair, one man except,\n Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen\n A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd\n By Angels numberless, thy daily Train.\n\n So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd;\n Into the Heart of Eve his words made way,\n Though at the voice much marveling; at length\n Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake.\n What may this mean?   Language of Man pronounc't\n By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest?\n The first at lest of these I thought deni'd\n To Beasts, whom God on thir Creation-Day\n Created mute to all articulat sound;\n The latter I demurre, for in thir looks\n Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers.\n Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field\n I knew, but not with human voice endu'd;\n Redouble then this miracle, and say,\n How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how\n To me so friendly grown above the rest\n Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?\n Say, for such wonder claims attention due.\n\n To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd.\n Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve,\n Easie to mee it is to tell thee all\n What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd:\n I was at first as other Beasts that graze\n The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low,\n As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd\n Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high:\n Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd\n A goodly Tree farr distant to behold\n Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt,\n Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze;\n When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n,\n Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense\n Then smell of sweetest Fenel or the Teats\n Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn,\n Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play.\n To satisfie the sharp desire I had\n Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd\n Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once,\n Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent\n Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene.\n About the mossie Trunk I wound me soon,\n For high from ground the branches would require\n Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree\n All other Beasts that saw, with like desire\n Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.\n Amid the Tree now got, where plenty hung\n Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill\n I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour\n At Feed or Fountain never had I found.\n Sated at length, ere long I might perceave\n Strange alteration in me, to degree\n Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech\n Wanted not long, though to this shape retain'd.\n Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep\n I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind\n Considerd all things visible in Heav'n,\n Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good;\n But all that fair and good in thy Divine\n Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray\n United I beheld; no Fair to thine\n Equivalent or second, which compel'd\n Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come\n And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd\n Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame.\n\n So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and Eve\n Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd.\n\n Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt\n The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd:\n But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far?\n For many are the Trees of God that grow\n In Paradise, and various, yet unknown\n To us, in such aboundance lies our choice,\n As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht,\n Still hanging incorruptible, till men\n Grow up to thir provision, and more hands\n Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth.\n\n To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad.\n Empress, the way is readie, and not long,\n Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat,\n Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past\n Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept\n My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon.\n\n Lead then, said Eve.   Hee leading swiftly rowld\n In tangles, and made intricate seem strait,\n To mischief swift.   Hope elevates, and joy\n Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire,\n Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night\n Condenses, and the cold invirons round,\n Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame,\n Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends\n Hovering and blazing with delusive Light,\n Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way\n To Boggs and Mires, and oft through Pond or Poole,\n There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr.\n So glister'd the dire Snake, and into fraud\n Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree\n Of prohibition, root of all our woe;\n Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.\n\n Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither,\n Fruitless to mee, though Fruit be here to excess,\n The credit of whose vertue rest with thee,\n Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects.\n But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch;\n God so commanded, and left that Command\n Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live\n Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law.\n\n To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd.\n Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit\n Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate,\n Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire?\n\n To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit\n Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate,\n But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst\n The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate\n Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die.\n\n She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold\n The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love\n To Man, and indignation at his wrong,\n New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd,\n Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely and in act\n Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin.\n As when of old som Orator renound\n In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence\n Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest,\n Stood in himself collected, while each part,\n Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue,\n Somtimes in highth began, as no delay\n Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right.\n So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown\n The Tempter all impassiond thus began.\n\n O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,\n Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power\n Within me cleere, not onely to discerne\n Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes\n Of highest Agents, deemd however wise.\n Queen of this Universe, doe not believe\n Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:\n How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life\n To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee,\n Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live,\n And life more perfet have attaind then Fate\n Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot.\n Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast\n Is open? or will God incense his ire\n For such a petty Trespass, and not praise\n Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain\n Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be,\n Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade\n To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;\n Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil\n Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd?\n God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;\n Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeyd:\n Your feare it self of Death removes the feare.\n Why then was this forbid?   Why but to awe,\n Why but to keep ye low and ignorant,\n His worshippers; he knows that in the day\n Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere,\n Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then\n Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods,\n Knowing both Good and Evil as they know.\n That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man,\n Internal Man, is but proportion meet,\n I of brute human, yee of human Gods.\n So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off\n Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht,\n Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring.\n And what are Gods that Man may not become\n As they, participating God-like food?\n The Gods are first, and that advantage use\n On our belief, that all from them proceeds;\n I question it, for this fair Earth I see,\n Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind,\n Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd\n Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,\n That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains\n Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies\n Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know?\n What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree\n Impart against his will if all be his?\n Or is it envie, and can envie dwell\n In heav'nly breasts? these, these and many more\n Causes import your need of this fair Fruit.\n Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste.\n\n He ended, and his words replete with guile\n Into her heart too easie entrance won:\n Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold\n Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound\n Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd\n With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth;\n Mean while the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd\n An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell\n So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire,\n Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,\n Sollicited her longing eye; yet first\n Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd.\n\n Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits,\n Though kept from Man, and worthy to be admir'd,\n Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay\n Gave elocution to the mute, and taught\n The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise:\n Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use,\n Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree\n Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;\n Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding\n Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good\n By thee communicated, and our want:\n For good unknown, sure is not had, or had\n And yet unknown, is as not had at all.\n In plain then, what forbids he but to know,\n Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?\n Such prohibitions binde not.   But if Death\n Bind us with after-bands, what profits then\n Our inward freedom?   In the day we eate\n Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.\n How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives,\n And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns,\n Irrational till then.   For us alone\n Was death invented? or to us deni'd\n This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd?\n For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first\n Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy\n The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect,\n Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.\n What fear I then, rather what know to feare\n Under this ignorance of good and Evil,\n Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?\n Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,\n Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,\n Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then\n To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?\n\n So saying, her rash hand in evil hour\n Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat:\n Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat\n Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,\n That all was lost.   Back to the Thicket slunk\n The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve\n Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else\n Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd,\n In Fruit she never tasted, whether true\n Or fansied so, through expectation high\n Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought.\n Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint,\n And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,\n And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon,\n Thus to her self she pleasingly began.\n\n O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees\n In Paradise, of operation blest\n To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd,\n And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end\n Created; but henceforth my early care,\n Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise\n Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease\n Of thy full branches offer'd free to all;\n Till dieted by thee I grow mature\n In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;\n Though others envie what they cannot give;\n For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here\n Thus grown.   Experience, next to thee I owe,\n Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind\n In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way,\n And giv'st access, though secret she retire.\n And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high,\n High and remote to see from thence distinct\n Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps\n May have diverted from continual watch\n Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies\n About him.   But to Adam in what sort\n Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known\n As yet my change, and give him to partake\n Full happiness with mee, or rather not,\n But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power\n Without Copartner? so to add what wants\n In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,\n And render me more equal, and perhaps,\n A thing not undesireable, somtime\n Superior; for inferior who is free?\n This may be well: but what if God have seen,\n And Death ensue? then I shall be no more,\n And Adam wedded to another Eve,\n Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;\n A death to think.   Confirm'd then I resolve;\nAdam shall share with me in bliss or woe:\n So dear I love him, that with him all deaths\n I could endure, without him live no life.\n\n So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,\n But first low Reverence don, as to the power\n That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd\n Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd\n From Nectar, drink of Gods.   Adam the while\n Waiting desirous her return, had wove\n Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne\n Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown,\n As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.\n Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new\n Solace in her return, so long delay'd;\n Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,\n Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;\n And forth to meet her went, the way she took\n That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree\n Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,\n Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand\n A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd,\n New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd.\n To him she hasted, in her face excuse\n Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,\n Which with bland words at will she thus addrest.\n\n Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay?\n Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd\n Thy presence, agonie of love till now\n Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more\n Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought,\n The pain of absence from thy sight.   But strange\n Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:\n This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree\n Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown\n Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect\n To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;\n And hath bin tasted such: the Serpent wise,\n Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,\n Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become,\n Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth\n Endu'd with human voice and human sense,\n Reasoning to admiration, and with mee\n Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I\n Have also tasted, and have also found\n Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,\n Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,\n And growing up to Godhead; which for thee\n Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.\n For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,\n Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon.\n Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot\n May joyne us, equal joy, as equal Love;\n Least thou not tasting, different degree\n Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce\n Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit.\n\n Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told;\n But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.\n On th' other side, Adam, soon as he heard\n The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz'd,\n Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill\n Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd;\n From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for Eve\n Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed:\n Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length\n First to himself he inward silence broke.\n\n O fairest of Creation, last and best\n Of all Gods works, Creature in whom excell'd\n Whatever can to sight or thought be formd,\n Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!\n How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost,\n Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote?\n Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress\n The strict forbiddance, how to violate\n The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud\n Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown,\n And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee\n Certain my resolution is to Die;\n How can I live without thee, how forgoe\n Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd,\n To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn?\n Should God create another Eve, and I\n Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee\n Would never from my heart; no no, I feel\n The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh,\n Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State\n Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.\n So having said, as one from sad dismay\n Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd\n Submitting to what seemd remediless,\n Thus in calm mood his Words to Eve he turnd.\n\n Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous Eve,\n And peril great provok't, who thus hath dar'd\n Had it been onely coveting to Eye\n That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence,\n Much more to taste it under banne to touch.\n But past who can recall, or don undoe?\n Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate, yet so\n Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact\n Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit,\n Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first\n Made common and unhallowd ere our taste;\n Nor yet on him found deadly, he yet lives,\n Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man\n Higher degree of Life, inducement strong\n To us, as likely tasting to attaine\n Proportional ascent, which cannot be\n But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods.\n Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,\n Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy\n Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high,\n Set over all his Works, which in our Fall,\n For us created, needs with us must faile,\n Dependent made; so God shall uncreate,\n Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose,\n Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power\n Creation could repeate, yet would be loath\n Us to abolish, least the Adversary\n Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God\n Most Favors, who can please him long; Mee first\n He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next?\n Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe,\n However I with thee have fixt my Lot,\n Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death\n Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life;\n So forcible within my heart I feel\n The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne,\n My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;\n Our State cannot be severd, we are one,\n One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self.\n\n So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli'd.\n O glorious trial of exceeding Love,\n Illustrious evidence, example high!\n Ingaging me to emulate, but short\n Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine,\n Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung,\n And gladly of our Union heare thee speak,\n One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff\n This day affords, declaring thee resolvd,\n Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread\n Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare,\n To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime,\n If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit,\n Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds,\n Direct, or by occasion hath presented\n This happie trial of thy Love, which else\n So eminently never had bin known.\n Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue\n This my attempt, I would sustain alone\n The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die\n Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact\n Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd\n Remarkably so late of thy so true,\n So faithful Love unequald; but I feel\n Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life\n Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes,\n Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before\n Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.\n On my experience, Adam, freely taste,\n And fear of Death deliver to the Windes.\n\n So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy\n Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love\n Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr\n Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death.\n In recompence (for such compliance bad\n Such recompence best merits) from the bough\n She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit\n With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat\n Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd,\n But fondly overcome with Femal charm.\n Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again\n In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan,\n Skie lowr'd and muttering Thunder, som sad drops\n Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin\n Original; while Adam took no thought,\n Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate\n Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe\n Him with her lov'd societie, that now\n As with new Wine intoxicated both\n They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel\n Divinitie within them breeding wings\n Wherewith to scorne the Earth: but that false Fruit\n Farr other operation first displaid,\n Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve\n Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him\n As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne:\n Till Adam thus'gan Eve to dalliance move,\n\nEve, now I see thou art exact of taste,\n And elegant, of Sapience no small part,\n Since to each meaning savour we apply,\n And Palate call judicious; I the praise\n Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd.\n Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd\n From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now\n True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be\n In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd,\n For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten.\n But come, so well refresh't, now let us play,\n As meet is, after such delicious Fare;\n For never did thy Beautie since the day\n I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd\n With all perfections, so enflame my sense\n With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now\n Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree.\n\n So said he, and forbore not glance or toy\n Of amorous intent, well understood\n Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire.\n Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank,\n Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd\n He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch,\n Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel,\n And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap.\n There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport\n Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale,\n The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep\n Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play.\n Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit,\n That with exhilerating vapour bland\n About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers\n Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep\n Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams\n Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose\n As from unrest, and each the other viewing,\n Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds\n How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile\n Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon,\n Just confidence, and native righteousness\n And honour from about them, naked left\n To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe\n Uncover'd more, so rose the Danite strong\nHerculean Samson from the Harlot-lap\n Of Philistean Dalilah, and wak'd\n Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare\n Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face\n Confounded long they sate, as struck'n mute,\n Till Adam, though not less then Eve abash't,\n At length gave utterance to these words constraind.\n\nEve, in evil hour thou didst give eare\n To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught\n To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall,\n False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes\n Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know\n Both Good and Evil, Good lost, and Evil got,\n Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know,\n Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void,\n Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie,\n Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind,\n And in our Faces evident the signes\n Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;\n Even shame, the last of evils; of the first\n Be sure then.   How shall I behold the face\n Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy\n And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes\n Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze\n Insufferably bright.   O might I here\n In solitude live savage, in some glade\n Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable\n To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad\n And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines,\n Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs\n Hide me, where I may never see them more.\n But let us now, as in bad plight, devise\n What best may from the present serve to hide\n The Parts of each for other, that seem most\n To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen,\n Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd,\n And girded on our loyns, may cover round\n Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame,\n There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.\n\n So counsel'd hee, and both together went\n Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose\n The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd,\n But such as at this day to Indians known\n In Malabar or Decan spreds her Armes\n Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground\n The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow\n About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade\n High overarch't, and echoing Walks between;\n There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heate\n Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds\n At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves\n They gatherd, broad as Amazonian Targe,\n And with what skill they had, together sowd,\n To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide\n Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike\n To that first naked Glorie.   Such of late\nColumbus found th' American so girt\n With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde\n Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores.\n Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part\n Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind,\n They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares\n Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within\n Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate,\n Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore\n Thir inward State of Mind, calm Region once\n And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent:\n For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will\n Heard not her lore, both in subjection now\n To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe\n Usurping over sovran Reason claimd\n Superior sway: from thus distemperd brest,\nAdam, estrang'd in look and alterd stile,\n Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewd.\n\n Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, and stai'd\n With me, as I besought thee, when that strange\n Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn,\n I know not whence possessd thee; we had then\n Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild\n Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable.\n Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve\n The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek\n Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile.\n\n To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus Eve.\n What words have past thy Lips, Adam severe,\n Imput'st thou that to my default, or will\n Of wandring, as thou call'st it, which who knows\n But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by,\n Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou been there,\n Or here th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd\n Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;\n No ground of enmitie between us known,\n Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme,\n Was I to have never parted from thy side?\n As good have grown there still a liveless Rib.\n Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head\n Command me absolutely not to go,\n Going into such danger as thou saidst?\n Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay,\n Nay didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.\n Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent,\n Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee.\n\n To whom then first incenst Adam repli'd,\n Is this the Love, is this the recompence\n Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest\n Immutable when thou wert lost, not I,\n Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss,\n Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee:\n And am I now upbraided, as the cause\n Of thy transgressing? not enough severe,\n It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more?\n I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold\n The danger, and the lurking Enemie\n That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force,\n And force upon free will hath here no place.\n But confidence then bore thee on, secure\n Either to meet no danger, or to finde\n Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps\n I also err'd in overmuch admiring\n What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought\n No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue\n That errour now, which is become my crime,\n And thou th' accuser.   Thus it shall befall\n Him who to worth in Women overtrusting\n Lets her will rule; restraint she will not brook,\n And left to her self, if evil thence ensue,\n Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse.\n\n Thus they in mutual accusation spent\n The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning,\n And of thir vain contest appeer'd no end.",
        "Paradise Lost: Book 11 (1674 version)": "Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood\n Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above\n Prevenient Grace descending had remov'd\n The stonie from thir hearts, & made new flesh\n Regenerate grow instead, that sighs now breath'd\n Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer\n Inspir'd, and wing'd for Heav'n with speedier flight\n Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port\n Not of mean suiters, nor important less\n Seem'd thir Petition, then when th' ancient Pair\n In Fables old, less ancient yet then these,\nDeucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore\n The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine\n Of Themis stood devout. To Heav'n thir prayers\n Flew up, nor missd the way, by envious windes\n Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passd\n Dimentionless through Heav'nly dores; then clad\n With incense, where the Golden Altar fum'd,\n By thir great Intercessor, came in sight\n Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son\n Presenting, thus to intercede began.\n\n See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung\n From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs\n And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt\n With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring,\n Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed\n Sow'n with contrition in his heart, then those\n Which his own hand manuring all the Trees\n Of Paradise could have produc't, ere fall'n\n From innocence. Now therefore bend thine eare\n To supplication, heare his sighs though mute;\n Unskilful with what words to pray, Iet mee\n Interpret for him, mee his Advocate\n And propitiation, all his works on mee\n Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those\n Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay.\n Accept me, and in mee from these receave\n The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live\n Before thee reconcil'd, at least his days\n Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I\n To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse)\n To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee\n All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss,\n Made one with me as I with thee am one.\n\n To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene.\n All thy request for Man, accepted Son,\n Obtain, all thy request was my Decree:\n But longer in that Paradise to dwell,\n The Law I gave to Nature him forbids:\n Those pure immortal Elements that know\n No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule,\n Eject him tainted now, and purge him off\n As a distemper, gross to aire as gross,\n And mortal food, as may dispose him best\n For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first\n Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt\n Corrupted. I at first with two fair gifts\n Created him endowd, with Happiness\n And Immortalitie: that fondly lost,\n This other serv'd but to eternize woe;\n Till I provided Death; so Death becomes\n His final remedie, and after Life\n Tri'd in sharp tribulation, and refin'd\n By Faith and faithful works, to second Life,\n Wak't in the renovation of the just,\n Resignes him up with Heav'n and Earth renewd.\n But let us call to Synod all the Blest\n Through Heav'ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide\n My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed,\n As how with peccant Angels late they saw;\n And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd.\n\n He ended, and the Son gave signal high\n To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew\n His Trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps\n When God descended, and perhaps once more\n To sound at general Doom. Th' Angelic blast\n Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs\n Of Amarantin Shade, Fountain or Spring,\n By the waters of Life, where ere they sate\n In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light\n Hasted, resorting to the Summons high,\n And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream\n Th' Almighty thus pronouncd his sovran Will.\n\n O Sons, like one of us Man is become\n To know both Good and Evil, since his taste\n Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast\n His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,\n Happier, had it suffic'd him to have known\n Good by it self, and Evil not at all.\n He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite,\n My motions in him, longer then they move,\n His heart I know, how variable and vain\n Self-left. Least therefore his now bolder hand\n Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,\n And live for ever, dream at least to live\n For ever, to remove him I decree,\n And send him from the Garden forth to Till\n The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile.\n\nMichael, this my behest have thou in charge,\n Take to thee from among the Cherubim\n Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend\n Or in behalf of Man, or to invade\n Vacant possession som new trouble raise:\n Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God\n Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair,\n From hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounce\n To them and to thir Progenie from thence\n Perpetual banishment. Yet least they faint\n At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd,\n For I behold them softn'd and with tears\n Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide.\n If patiently thy bidding they obey,\n Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale\n To Adam what shall come in future dayes,\n As I shall thee enlighten, intermix\n My Cov'nant in the womans seed renewd;\n So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:\n And on the East side of the Garden place,\n Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes,\n Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame\n Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright,\n And guard all passage to the Tree of Life:\n Least Paradise a receptacle prove\n To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,\n With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude.\n\n He ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power prepar'd\n For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright\n Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each\n Had, like a double Janus, all thir shape\n Spangl'd with eyes more numerous then those\n Of Argus, and more wakeful then to drouze,\n Charm'd with Arcadian Pipe, the Pastoral Reed\n Of Hermes, or his opiate Rod. Mean while\n To resalute the World with sacred Light\nLeucothea wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd\n The Earth, when Adam and first Matron Eve\n Had ended now thir Orisons, and found\n Strength added from above, new hope to spring\n Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;\n Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewd.\n\nEve, easily may Faith admit, that all\n The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends;\n But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n\n So prevalent as to concerne the mind\n Of God high-blest, or to incline his will,\n Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,\n Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne\n Ev'n to the Seat of God. For since I saught\n By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease,\n Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart,\n Methought I saw him placable and mild,\n Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew\n That I was heard with favour; peace returnd\n Home to my Brest, and to my memorie\n His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;\n Which then not minded in dismay, yet now\n Assures me that the bitterness of death\n Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee,\nEve rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind,\n Mother of all things living, since by thee\n Man is to live, and all things live for Man.\n\n To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek.\n Ill worthie I such title should belong\n To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind\n A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach\n Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:\n But infinite in pardon was my Judge,\n That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't\n The sourse of life; next favourable thou,\n Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf'st,\n Farr other name deserving. But the Field\n To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd,\n Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,\n All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins\n Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,\n I never from thy side henceforth to stray,\n Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind\n Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,\n What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?\n Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content.\n\n So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd Eve, but Fate\n Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest\n On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd\n After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight\n The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour,\n Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove:\n Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,\n First hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace,\n Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;\n Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.\nAdam observ'd, and with his Eye the chase\n Pursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus spake.\n\n O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh,\n Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews\n Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn\n Us haply too secure of our discharge\n From penaltie, because from death releast\n Some days; how long, and what till then our life,\n Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust,\n And thither must return and be no more.\n Why else this double object in our fight\n Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground\n One way the self-same hour? why in the East\n Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light\n More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws\n O're the blew Firmament a radiant white,\n And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught.\n\n He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands\n Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now\n In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,\n A glorious Apparition, had not doubt\n And carnal fear that day dimm'd Adams eye.\n Not that more glorious, when the Angels met\nJacob in Mahanaim, where he saw\n The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright;\n Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd\n In Dothan, cover'd with a Camp of Fire,\n Against the Syrian King, who to surprize\n One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,\n Warr unproclam'd. The Princely Hierarch\n In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise\n Possession of the Garden; hee alone,\n To find where Adam shelterd, took his way,\n Not unperceav'd of Adam, who to Eve,\n While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake.\n\n Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps\n Of us will soon determin, or impose\n New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie\n From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill\n One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate\n None of the meanest, some great Potentate\n Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie\n Invests him coming; yet not terrible,\n That I should fear, nor sociably mild,\n As Raphael, that I should much confide,\n But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,\n With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.\n He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,\n Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man\n Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes\n A militarie Vest of purple flowd\n Livelier then Meliboean, or the graine\n Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's old\n In time of Truce; lris had dipt the wooff;\n His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime\n In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side\n As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword,\n Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.\nAdam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State\n Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd.\n\nAdam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs:\n Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,\n Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,\n Defeated of his seisure many dayes\n Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent,\n And one bad act with many deeds well done\n Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd\n Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claime;\n But longer in this Paradise to dwell\n Permits not; to remove thee I am come,\n And send thee from the Garden forth to till\n The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile.\n\n He added not, for Adam at the newes\n Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,\n That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen\n Yet all had heard, with audible lament\n Discover'd soon the place of her retire.\n\n O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!\n Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave\n Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades,\n Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,\n Quiet though sad, the respit of that day\n That must be mortal to us both. O flours,\n That never will in other Climate grow,\n My early visitation, and my last\n At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand\n From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names,\n Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke\n Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount?\n Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd\n With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee\n How shall I part, and whither wander down\n Into a lower World, to this obscure\n And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire\n Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?\n\n Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde.\n Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne\n What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,\n Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine;\n Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes\n Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;\n Where he abides, think there thy native soile.\n\nAdam by this from the cold sudden damp\n Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,\n To Michael thus his humble words addressd.\n\n Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd\n Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem\n Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould\n Thy message, which might else in telling wound,\n And in performing end us; what besides\n Of sorrow and dejection and despair\n Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,\n Departure from this happy place, our sweet\n Recess, and onely consolation left\n Familiar to our eyes, all places else\n Inhospitable appeer and desolate,\n Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer\n Incessant I could hope to change the will\n Of him who all things can, I would not cease\n To wearie him with my assiduous cries:\n But prayer against his absolute Decree\n No more availes then breath against the winde,\n Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:\n Therefore to his great bidding I submit.\n This most afflicts me, that departing hence,\n As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd\n His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent,\n With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd\n Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate;\n On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree\n Stood visible, among these Pines his voice\n I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd:\n So many grateful Altars I would reare\n Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone\n Of lustre from the brook, in memorie,\n Or monument to Ages, and thereon\n Offer sweet smelling Gumms and Fruits and Flours:\n In yonder nether World where shall I seek\n His bright appearances, or foot-step trace?\n For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd\n To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now\n Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts\n Of glory, and farr off his steps adore.\n\n To whom thus Michael with regard benigne.\nAdam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth.\n Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills\n Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives,\n Fomented by his virtual power and warmd:\n All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,\n No despicable gift; surmise not then\n His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd\n Of Paradise or Eden: this had been\n Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred\n All generations, and had hither come\n From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate\n And reverence thee thir great Progenitor.\n But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down\n To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons:\n Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in plaine\n God is as here, and will be found alike\n Present, and of his presence many a signe\n Still following thee, still compassing thee round\n With goodness and paternal Love, his Face\n Express, and of his steps the track Divine.\n Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd\n Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent\n To shew thee what shall come in future dayes\n To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad\n Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending\n With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn\n True patience, and to temper joy with fear\n And pious sorrow, equally enur'd\n By moderation either state to beare,\n Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead\n Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure\n Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend\n This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes)\n Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st,\n As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd.\n\n To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd.\n Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path\n Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit,\n However chast'ning, to the evil turne\n My obvious breast, arming to overcom\n By suffering, and earne rest from labour won,\n If so I may attain.   So both ascend\n In the Visions of God: It was a Hill\n Of Paradise the highest, from whose top\n The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken\n Stretcht out to the amplest reach of prospect lay.\n Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,\n Whereon for different cause the Tempter set\n Our second Adam in the Wilderness,\n To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory.\n His Eye might there command wherever stood\n City of old or modern Fame, the Seat\n Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls\n Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can\n And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne,\n To Paquin of Sinaean Kings, and thence\n To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul\n Down to the golden Chersonese, or where\n The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since\n In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar\n In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance,\nTurchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken\n Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port\nErcoco and the less Maritim Kings\nMombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind,\n And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme\n Of Congo, and Angola fardest South;\n Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount\n The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus,\nMarocco and Algiers, and Tremisen;\n On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway\n The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw\n Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume,\n And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat\n Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd\nGuiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons\n Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights\nMichael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd\n Which that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight\n Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue\n The visual Nerve, for he had much to see;\n And from the Well of Life three drops instill'd.\n So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd,\n Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight,\n That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes,\n Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst:\n But him the gentle Angel by the hand\n Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd.\n\nAdam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold\n Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought\n In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd\n Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd,\n Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive\n Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds.\n\n His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field,\n Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves\n New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds;\n Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood\n Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon\n A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought\n First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf,\n Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next\n More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock\n Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid\n The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd,\n On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd.\n His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n\n Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame;\n The others not, for his was not sincere;\n Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd,\n Smote him into the Midriff with a stone\n That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale\n Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd.\n Much at that sight was Adam in his heart\n Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd.\n\n O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n\n To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd;\n Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid?\n\n T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd.\n These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come\n Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain,\n For envie that his Brothers Offering found\n From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact\n Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd\n Loose no reward, though here thou see him die,\n Rowling in dust and gore.   To which our Sire.\n\n Alas, both for the deed and for the cause!\n But have I now seen Death? Is this the way\n I must return to native dust? O sight\n Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,\n Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!\n\n To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen\n In his first shape on man; but many shapes\n Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead\n To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense\n More terrible at th' entrance then within.\n Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die,\n By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more\n In Meats and Drinks which on the Earth shall bring\n Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew\n Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know\n What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve\n Shall bring on men.   Immediately a place\n Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,\n A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid\n Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies\n Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes\n Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,\n Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,\n Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,\n Daemoniac Phrenzie, moaping Melancholie\n And Moon-struck madness, pining Atrophie,\n Marasmus, and wide-wasting Pestilence,\n Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums.\n Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair\n Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;\n And over them triumphant Death his Dart\n Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't\n With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope.\n Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long\n Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept,\n Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd\n His best of Man, and gave him up to tears\n A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,\n And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd.\n\n O miserable Mankind, to what fall\n Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd!\n Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n\n To be thus wrested from us? rather why\n Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew\n What we receive, would either not accept\n Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down,\n Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus\n Th' Image of God in man created once\n So goodly and erect, though faultie since,\n To such unsightly sufferings be debas't\n Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man,\n Retaining still Divine similitude\n In part, from such deformities be free,\n And for his Makers Image sake exempt?\n\n Thir Makers Image,   answerd Michael, then\n Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd\n To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took\n His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice,\n Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.\n Therefore so abject is thir punishment,\n Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,\n Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't\n While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules\n To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they\n Gods Image did not reverence in themselves.\n\n I yield it just,   said Adam,   and submit.\n But is there yet no other way, besides\n These painful passages, how we may come\n To Death, and mix with our connatural dust;\n\n There is,   said Michael,   if thou well observe\n The rule of not too much, by temperance taught\n In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence\n Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,\n Till many years over thy head return:\n So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop\n Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease\n Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:\n This is old age; but then thou must outlive\n Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change\n To witherd weak and gray; thy Senses then\n Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,\n To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth\n Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne\n A Melancholy damp of cold and dry\n To weigh thy Spirits down, and last consume\n The Balme of Life.   To whom our Ancestor.\n\n Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong\n Life much, bent rather how I may be quit\n Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge,\n Which I must keep till my appointed day\n Of rendring up, and patiently attend\n My dissolution.   Michael repli'd.\n\n Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst\n Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n:\n And now prepare thee for another sight.\n\n He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon\n Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds\n Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound\n Of Instruments that made melodious chime\n Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd\n Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch\n Instinct through all proportions low and high\n Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue.\n In other part stood one who at the Forge\n Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass Had melted (whether found where casual fire\n Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,\n Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot\n To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream\n From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind\n Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd\n First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought\n Fusil or grav'n in mettle. After these,\n But on the hether side a different sort\n From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat,\n Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise\n Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent\n To worship God aright, and know his works\n Not hid, nor those things last which might preserve\n Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain\n Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold\n A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay\n In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung\n Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:\n The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes\n Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net\n Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose;\n And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star\n Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat\n They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke\nHymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't;\n With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.\n Such happy interview and fair event\n Of love and youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,\n And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart\n Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight,\n The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd.\n\n True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,\n Much better seems this Vision, and more hope\n Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;\n Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse,\n Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends.\n\n To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best\n By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,\n Created, as thou art, to nobler end\n Holie and pure, conformitie divine.\n Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents\n Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race\n Who slew his Brother; studious they appere\n Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,\n Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit\n Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none.\n Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;\n For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd\n Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,\n Yet empty of all good wherein consists\n Womans domestic honour and chief praise;\n Bred onely and completed to the taste\n Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance,\n To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.\n To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives\n Religious titl'd them the Sons of God,\n Shall yield up all thir vertue, all thir fame\n Ignobly, to the traines and to the smiles\n Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,\n (Erelong to swim at large) and laugh; for which\n The world erelong a world of tears must weepe.\n\n To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft.\n O pittie and shame, that they who to live well\n Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread\n Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!\n But still I see the tenor of Mans woe\n Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.\n\n From Mans effeminate slackness it begins,\n Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place\n By wisdome, and superiour gifts receav'd.\n But now prepare thee for another Scene.\n\n He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred\n Before him, Towns, and rural works between,\n Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,\n Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,\n Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;\n Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,\n Single or in Array of Battel rang'd\n Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;\n One way a Band select from forage drives\n A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine\n From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,\n Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,\n Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye,\n But call in aide, which makes a bloody Fray;\n With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine;\n Where Cattle pastur'd late, now scatterd lies\n With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field\n Deserted: Others to a Citie strong\n Lay Seige, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine,\n Assaulting; others from the wall defend\n With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire;\n On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.\n In other part the scepter'd Haralds call\n To Council in the Citie Gates: anon\n Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,\n Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon\n In factious opposition, till at last\n Of middle Age one rising, eminent\n In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,\n Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,\n And Judgment from above: him old and young\n Exploded and had seiz'd with violent hands,\n Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence\n Unseen amid the throng: so violence\n Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law\n Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found.\nAdam was all in tears, and to his guide\n Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,\n Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death\n Inhumanly to men, and multiply\n Ten thousandfould the sin of him who slew\n His Brother; for of whom such massacher\n Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men?\n But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n\n Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost?\n\n To whom thus Michael. These are the product\n Of those ill mated Marriages thou saw'st;\n Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves\n Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,\n Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.\n Such were these Giants, men of high renown;\n For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd,\n And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd;\n To overcome in Battle, and subdue\n Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite\n Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch\n Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done\n Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours,\n Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,\n Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men.\n Thus Fame shall be atchiev'd, renown on Earth,\n And what most merits fame in silence hid.\n But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst\n The onely righteous in a World perverse,\n And therefore hated, therefore so beset\n With Foes for daring single to be just,\n And utter odious Truth, that God would come\n To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High\n Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds\n Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God\n High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,\n Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward\n Awaits the good, the rest what punishment;\n Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.\n\n He look'd, and saw the face of things quite chang'd,\n The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,\n All now was turn'd to jollitie and game,\n To luxurie and riot, feast and dance,\n Marrying or prostituting, as befell,\n Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire\n Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.\n At length a Reverend Sire among them came,\n And of thir doings great dislike declar'd,\n And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft\n Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,\n Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd\n Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls\n In Prison under Judgements imminent:\n But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd\n Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off;\n Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,\n Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,\n Measur'd by Cubit, length, and breadth, and highth,\n Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore\n Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large\n For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!\n Of every Beast, and Bird, and Insect small\n Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught\n Thir order: last the Sire, and his three Sons\n With thir four Wives; and God made fast the dore.\n Meanwhile the Southwind rose, and with black wings\n Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove\n From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie\n Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,\n Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie\n Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain\n Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth\n No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum\n Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow\n Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else\n Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp\n Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea,\n Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces\n Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd\n And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late,\n All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't.\n How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold\n The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,\n Depopulation; thee another Floud,\n Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd,\n And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard\n By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,\n Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns\n His Children, all in view destroyd at once;\n And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.\n\n O Visions ill foreseen! better had I\n Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne\n My part of evil onely, each dayes lot\n Anough to beare; those now, that were dispenst\n The burd'n of many Ages, on me light\n At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth\n Abortive, to torment me ere thir being,\n With thought that they must be. Let no man seek\n Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall\n Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure,\n Which neither his foreknowing can prevent,\n And hee the future evil shall no less\n In apprehension then in substance feel\n Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,\n Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't\n Famin and anguish will at last consume\n Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope\n When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth,\n All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd\n With length of happy dayes the race of man;\n But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see\n Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste.\n How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide,\n And whether here the Race of man will end.\n To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst\n In Triumph and luxurious wealth, are they\n First seen in acts of prowess eminent\n And great exploits, but of true vertu void;\n Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste\n Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby\n Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,\n Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,\n Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride\n Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace.\n The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr\n Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose\n And fear of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd\n In sharp contest of Battel found no aide\n Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale\n Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,\n Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords\n Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear\n More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd:\n So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd,\n Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;\n One Man except, the onely Son of light\n In a dark Age, against example good,\n Against allurement, custom, and a World\n Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn,\n Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes\n Shall them admonish, and before them set\n The paths of righteousness, how much more safe,\n And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come\n On thir impenitence; and shall returne\n Of them derided, but of God observd\n The one just Man alive; by his command\n Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,\n To save himself and household from amidst\n A World devote to universal rack.\n No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast\n Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd,\n And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts\n Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre\n Raine day and night, all fountains of the Deep\n Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp\n Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise\n Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount\n Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd\n Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud,\n With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift\n Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf,\n And there take root an Iland salt and bare,\n The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.\n To teach thee that God attributes to place\n No sanctitie, if none be thither brought\n By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.\n And now what further shall ensue, behold.\n\n He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,\n Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled,\n Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie\n Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd;\n And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass\n Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,\n As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink\n From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole\n With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt\n His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut.\n The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground\n Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt.\n And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;\n With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive\n Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde.\n Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,\n And after him, the surer messenger,\n A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie\n Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;\n The second time returning, in his Bill\n An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:\n Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke\n The ancient Sire descends with all his Train;\n Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,\n Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds\n A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow\n Conspicuous with three listed colours gay,\n Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new.\n Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad\n Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth.\n\n O thou who future things canst represent\n As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive\n At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live\n With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve.\n Farr less I now lament for one whole World\n Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce\n For one Man found so perfet and so just,\n That God voutsafes to raise another World\n From him, and all his anger to forget.\n But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,\n Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd,\n Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde\n The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud,\n Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth?\n\n To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st;\n So willingly doth God remit his Ire,\n Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd,\n Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw\n The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh\n Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd,\n Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,\n That he relents, not to blot out mankind,\n And makes a Covenant never to destroy\n The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea\n Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World\n With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings\n Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set\n His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look\n And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night,\n Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost\n Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,\n Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.",
        "Paradise Lost: Book 12 (1674 version)": "AS one who in his journey bates at Noone, Though bent on speed, so heer the Archangel paus'd Betwixt the world destroy'd and world restor'd, If Adam aught perhaps might interpose; Then with transition sweet new Speech resumes.  Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end; And Man as from a second stock proceed. Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine Must needs impaire and wearie human sense: Henceforth what is to com I will relate, Thou therefore give due audience, and attend. This second sours of Men, while yet but few; And while the dread of judgement past remains Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie, With some regard to what is just and right Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace, Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop, Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock, Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid, With large Wine-offerings pour'd, and sacred Feast, Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam'd, and dwell Long time in peace by Families and Tribes Under paternal rule; till one shall rise Of proud ambitious heart, who not content With fair equalitie, fraternal state, Will arrogate Dominion undeserv'd Over his brethren, and quite dispossess Concord and law of Nature from the Earth; Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game) With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse Subjection to his Empire tyrannous: A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl'd Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav'n, Or from Heav'n claming second Sovrantie; And from Rebellion shall derive his name, Though of Rebellion others he accuse. Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns With him or under him to tyrannize, Marching from Eden towards the West, shall finde The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell; Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build A Citie and Towre, whose top may reach to Heav'n; And get themselves a name, least far disperst In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost Regardless whether good or evil fame. But God who oft descends to visit men Unseen, and through thir habitations walks To mark thir doings, them beholding soon, Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower Obstruct Heav'n Towrs, and in derision sets Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase Quite out thir Native Language, and instead To sow a jangling noise of words unknown: Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud Among the Builders; each to other calls Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage, As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav'n And looking down, to see the hubbub strange And hear the din; thus was the building left Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam'd.  Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeas'd. O execrable Son so to aspire Above his Brethren, to himself assuming Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv'n: He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl Dominion absolute; that right we hold By his donation; but Man over men He made not Lord; such title to himself Reserving, human left from human free. But this Usurper his encroachment proud Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food Will he convey up thither to sustain Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross, And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread?  To whom thus Michael. Justly thou abhorr'st That Son, who on the quiet state of men Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue Rational Libertie; yet know withall, Since thy original lapse, true Libertie Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells Twinn'd, and from her hath no dividual being: Reason in man obscur'd, or not obeyd, Immediately inordinate desires And upstart Passions catch the Government From Reason, and to servitude reduce Man till then free. Therefore since hee permits Within himself unworthie Powers to reign Over free Reason, God in judgement just Subjects him from without to violent Lords; Who oft as undeservedly enthrall His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be, Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse. Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong, But Justice, and some fatal curse annext Deprives them of thir outward libertie, Thir inward lost: Witness th' irreverent Son Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse, Servant of Seruants, on his vitious Race. Thus will this latter, as the former World, Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw His presence from among them, and avert His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth To leave them to thir own polluted wayes; And one peculiar Nation to select From all the rest, of whom to be invok'd, A Nation from one faithful man to spring: Him on this side Euphrates yet residing, Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown, While yet the Patriark liv'd, who scap'd the Flood, As to forsake the living God, and fall To worship thir own work in Wood and Stone For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes To call by Vision from his Fathers house, His kindred and false Gods, into a Land Which he will shew him, and from him will raise A mightie Nation, and upon him showre His benediction so, that in his Seed All Nations shall be blest; he straight obeys, Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes: I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the Ford To Haran, after him a cumbrous Train Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude; Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth With God, who call'd him, in a land unknown. Canaan he now attains, I see his Tents Pitcht about Sechem, and the neighbouring Plaine Of Moreh; there by promise he receaves Gift to his Progenie of all that Land; From Hamath Northward to the Desert South (Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam'd) From Hermon East to the great Western Sea, Mount Hermon, yonder Sea, each place behold In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare Mount Carmel; here the double-founted stream Jordan, true limit Eastward; but his Sons Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of Hills. This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon Plainlier shall be reveald. This Patriarch blest, Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call, A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves, Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown; The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs From Canaan, to a Land hereafter call'd Egypt, divided by the River Nile; See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land He comes invited by a yonger Son In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds Raise him to be the second in that Realme Of Pharao: there he dies, and leaves his Race Growing into a Nation, and now grown Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males: Till by two brethren (those two brethren call Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claime His people from enthralment, they return With glory and spoile back to thir promis'd Land. But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies To know thir God, or message to regard, Must be compelld by Signes and judgements dire; To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd, Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill With loath'd intrusion, and fill all the land; His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die, Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss, And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile, Haile mixt with fire must rend th' Egyptian Skie And wheel on th' Earth, devouring where it rouls; What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine, A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green: Darkness must overshadow all his bounds, Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes; Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born Of Egypt must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds The River-dragon tam'd at length submits To let his sojourners depart, and oft Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice More hard'nd after thaw, till in his rage Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass As on drie land between two christal walls, Aw'd by the rod of Moses so to stand Divided, till his rescu'd gain thir shoar: Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend, Though present in his Angel, who shall goe Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire, By day a Cloud, by night a Pillar of Fire, To guide them in thir journey, and remove Behinde them, while th' obdurat King pursues: All night he will pursue, but his approach Darkness defends between till morning Watch; Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud God looking forth will trouble all his Host And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command Moses once more his potent Rod extends Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys; On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return, And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect Safe towards Canaan from the shoar advance Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way, Least entring on the Canaanite allarmd Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather Inglorious life with servitude; for life To noble and ignoble is more sweet Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on. This also shall they gain by thir delay In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found Thir government, and thir great Senate choose Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind: God from the Mount of Sinai, whose gray top Shall tremble, he descending, will himself In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine To civil Justice, part religious Rites Of sacrifice, informing them, by types And shadows, of that destind Seed to bruise The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve Mankinds deliverance. But the voice of God To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech That Moses might report to them his will, And terror cease; he grants what they besaught Instructed that to God is no access Without Mediator, whose high Office now Moses in figure beares, to introduce One greater, of whose day he shall foretell, And all the Prophets in thir Age the times Of great Messiah shall sing. Thus Laws and Rites Establisht, such delight hath God in Men Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes Among them to set up his Tabernacle, The holy One with mortal Men to dwell: By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram'd Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony, The Records of his Cov'nant, over these A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing The Heav'nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud Shall rest by Day, a fiery gleame by Night, Save when they journie, and at length they come, Conducted by his Angel to the Land Promisd to Abraham and his Seed: the rest Were long to tell, how many Battels fought, How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won, Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav'n stand still A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne, Mans voice commanding, Sun in Gibeon stand, And thou Moon in the vale of Aialon, Till Israel overcome; so call the third From Abraham, Son of Isaac, and from him His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.  Here Adam interpos'd. O sent from Heav'n, Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne Just Abraham and his Seed: now first I finde Mine eyes true op'ning, and my heart much eas'd, Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest, Favour unmerited by me, who sought Forbidd'n knowledge by forbidd'n means. This yet I apprehend not, why to those Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth So many and so various Laws are giv'n; So many Laws argue so many sins Among them; how can God with such reside?  To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin Will reign among them, as of thee begot; And therefore was Law given them to evince Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up Sin against Law to fight; that when they see Law can discover sin, but not remove, Save by those shadowie expiations weak, The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man, Just for unjust, that in such righteousness To them by Faith imputed, they may finde Justification towards God, and peace Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part Perform, and not performing cannot live. So law appears imperfet, and but giv'n With purpose to resign them in full time Up to a better Cov'nant, disciplin'd From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit, From imposition of strict Laws, to free Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear To filial, works of Law to works of Faith. And therefore shall not Moses, though of God Highly belov'd, being but the Minister Of Law, his people into Canaan lead; But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call, His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell The adversarie Serpent, and bring back Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man Safe to eternal Paradise of rest. Meanwhile they in thir earthly Canaan plac't Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins National interrupt thir public peace, Provoking God to raise them enemies: From whom as oft he saves them penitent By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom The second, both for pietie renownd And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne For ever shall endure; the like shall sing All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock Of David (so I name this King) shall rise A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold, Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings The last, for of his Reign shall be no end. But first a long succession must ensue, And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam'd, The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine. Such follow him, as shall be registerd Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle, Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land, Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw'st Left in confusion, Babylon thence call'd. There in captivitie he lets them dwell The space of seventie years, then brings them back, Remembring mercie, and his Cov'nant sworn To David, stablisht as the dayes of Heav'n. Returnd from Babylon by leave of Kings Thir Lords, whom God dispos'd, the house of God They first re-edifie, and for a while In mean estate live moderate, till grown In wealth and multitude, factious they grow; But first among the Priests dissension springs, Men who attend the Altar, and should most Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise The Scepter, and regard not Davids Sons, Then loose it to a stranger, that the true Anointed King Messiah might be born Barr'd of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr Unseen before in Heav'n proclaims him com, And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold; His place of birth a solemn Angel tells To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night; They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung. A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire The Power of the most High; he shall ascend The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav'ns.  He ceas'd, discerning Adam with such joy Surcharg'd, as had like grief bin dew'd in tears, Without the vent of words, which these he breathd.  O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher Of utmost hope! now clear I understand What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain, Why our great expectation should be call'd The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile, High in the love of Heav'n, yet from my Loynes Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son Of God most High; So God with man unites. Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise Expect with mortal paine: say where and when Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel.  To whom thus Michael. Dream not of thir fight, As of a Duel, or the local wounds Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil Thy enemie; nor so is overcome Satan, whose fall from Heav'n, a deadlier bruise, Disabl'd not to give thee thy deaths wound: Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure, Not by destroying Satan, but his works In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be, But by fulfilling that which thou didst want, Obedience to the Law of God, impos'd On penaltie of death, and suffering death, The penaltie to thy transgression due, And due to theirs which out of thine will grow: So onely can high Justice rest appaid. The Law of God exact he shall fulfill Both by obedience and by love, though love Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment He shall endure by coming in the Flesh To a reproachful life and cursed death, Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe In his redemption, and that his obedience Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits To save them, not thir own, though legal works. For this he shall live hated, be blasphem'd, Seis'd on by force, judg'd, and to death condemnd A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life; But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies, The Law that is against thee, and the sins Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi'd, Never to hurt them more who rightly trust In this his satisfaction; so he dies, But soon revives, Death over him no power Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light, Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems, His death for Man, as many as offerd Life Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace By Faith not void of workes: this God-like act Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy'd, In sin for ever lost from life; this act Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes, And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel, Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep, A gentle wafting to immortal Life. Nor after resurrection shall he stay Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer To his Disciples, Men who in his Life Still follow'd him; to them shall leave in charge To teach all nations what of him they learn'd And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve Baptizing in the profluent stream, the signe Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life Pure, and in mind prepar'd, if so befall, For death, like that which the redeemer dy'd. All Nations they shall teach; for from that day Not onely to the Sons of Abrahams Loines Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons Of Abrahams Faith wherever through the world; So in his seed all Nations shall be blest. Then to the Heav'n of Heav'ns he shall ascend With victory, triumphing through the aire Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines Through all his Realme, and there confounded leave; Then enter into glory, and resume His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high Above all names in Heav'n; and thence shall come, When this worlds disolution shall be ripe, With glory and power to judge both quick and dead, To judge th' unfaithful dead, but to reward His faithful, and receave them into bliss, Whether in Heav'n or Earth, for then the Earth Shall all be Paradise, far happier place Then this of Eden, and far happier daies.  So spake th' Archangel Michael, then paus'd, As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire Replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd.  O goodness infinite, goodness immense! That all this good of evil shall produce, And evil turn to good; more wonderful Then that which by creation first brought forth Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand, Whether I should repent me now of sin By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring, To God more glory, more good will to Men From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound. But say, if our deliverer up to Heav'n Must reascend, what will betide the few His faithful, left among th' unfaithful herd, The enemies of truth; who then shall guide His people, who defend? will they not deale Wors with his followers then with him they dealt?  Be sure they will, said th' Angel; but from Heav'n Hee to his own a Comforter will send, The promise of the Father, who shall dwell His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write, To guide them in all truth, and also arme With spiritual Armour, able to resist Satans assaults, and quench his fierie darts, What man can do against them, not affraid, Though to the death, against such cruelties With inward consolations recompenc't, And oft supported so as shall amaze Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends To evangelize the Nations, then on all Baptiz'd, shall them with wondrous gifts endue To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles, As did thir Lord before them. Thus they win Great numbers of each Nation to receave With joy the tidings brought from Heav'n: at length Thir Ministry perform'd, and race well run, Thir doctrine and thir story written left, They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne, Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves, Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav'n To thir own vile advantages shall turne Of lucre and ambition, and the truth With superstitions and traditions taint, Left onely in those written Records pure, Though not but by the Spirit understood. Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, Places and titles, and with these to joine Secular power, though feigning still to act By spiritual, to themselves appropriating The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv'n To all Beleevers; and from that pretense, Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild His living Temples, built by Faith to stand, Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard Infallible? yet many will presume: Whence heavie persecution shall arise On all who in the worship persevere Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part, Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes Religion satisfi'd; Truth shall retire Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on, To good malignant, to bad men benigne, Under her own waight groaning till the day Appeer of respiration to the just, And vengeance to the wicked, at return Of him so lately promis'd to thy aid The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold, Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord, Last in the Clouds from Heav'n to be reveald In glory of the Father, to dissolve Satan with his perverted World, then raise From the conflagrant mass, purg'd and refin'd, New Heav'ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date Founded in righteousness and peace and love To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.  He ended; and thus Adam last reply'd. How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest, Measur'd this transient World, the Race of time, Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss, Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach. Greatly instructed I shall hence depart, Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill Of knowledge, what this Vessel can containe; Beyond which was my folly to aspire. Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best, And love with fear the onely God, to walk As in his presence, ever to observe His providence, and on him sole depend, Mercifull over all his works, with good Still overcoming evil, and by small Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake Is fortitude to highest victorie, And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life; Taught this by his example whom I now Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.  To whom thus also th' Angel last repli'd: This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe Of wisdome; hope no higher, though all the Starrs Thou knewst by name, and all th' ethereal Powers, All secrets of the deep, all Natures works, Or works of God in Heav'n, Aire, Earth, or Sea, And all the riches of this World enjoydst, And all the rule, one Empire; onely add Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith, Add vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love, By name to come call'd Charitie, the soul Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess A paradise within thee, happier farr. Let us descend now therefore from this top Of Speculation; for the hour precise Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards, By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword, In signal of remove, waves fiercely round; We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm'd Portending good, and all her spirits compos'd To meek submission: thou at season fit Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard, Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know, The great deliverance by her Seed to come (For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind. That ye may live, which will be many dayes, Both in one Faith unanimous though sad, With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer'd With meditation on the happie end.  He ended, and they both descend the Hill; Descended, Adam to the Bowre where Eve Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak't; And thus with words not sad she him receav'd.  Whence thou returnst, and whither wentst, I know; For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise, Which he hath sent propitious, some great good Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress Wearied I fell asleep: but now lead on; In mee is no delay; with thee to goe, Is to stay here; without thee here to stay, Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee Art all things under Heav'n, all places thou, Who for my wilful crime art banisht hence. This further consolation yet secure I carry hence; though all by mee is lost, Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft, By mee the Promis'd Seed shall all restore.  So spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heard Well pleas'd, but answer'd not; for now too nigh Th' Archangel stood, and from the other Hill To thir fixt Station, all in bright array The Cherubim descended; on the ground Gliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist Ris'n from a River o're the marish glides, And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel Homeward returning. High in Front advanc't, The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz'd Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat, And vapour as the Libyan Air adust, Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat In either hand the hastning Angel caught Our lingring Parents, and to th' Eastern Gate Led them direct, and down the Cliff as fast To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer'd. They looking back, all th' Eastern side beheld Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat, Wav'd over by that flaming Brand, the Gate With dreadful Faces throng'd and fierie Armes: Som natural tears they drop'd, but wip'd them soon; The World was all before them, where to choose Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide: They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow, Through Eden took thir solitarie way.",
        "On Shakespeare. 1630": "What needs my Shakespeare for his honoured bones,The labor of an age in piled stones,Or that his hallowed relics should be hid   Under a star-ypointing pyramid? Dear son of Memory, great heir of fame, What need'st thou such weak witness of thy name?Thou in our wonder and astonishment Hast built thyself a live-long monument. For whilst to th' shame of slow-endeavouring art,   Thy easy numbers flow, and that each heart   Hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book Those Delphic lines with deep impression took,   Then thou, our fancy of itself bereaving,   Dost make us marble with too much conceiving; And so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie,That kings for such a tomb would wish to die.",
        "Sonnet 13: Harry, whose tuneful and well-measured song": "To Mr. H. Lawes, On His Airs\n\n\n\nHarry, whose tuneful and well-measured song       First taught our English music how to span       Words with just note and accent, not to scan       With Midas' ears, committing short and long, Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng,       With praise enough for Envy to look wan;       To after-age thou shalt be writ the man       That with smooth air couldst humor best our tongue. Thou honor'st Verse, and Verse must lend her wing       To honor thee, the priest of Phoebus' choir,       That tun'st their happiest lines in hymn or story. Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher       Than his Casella, whom he wooed to sing,       Met in the milder shades of Purgatory.",
        "Sonnet 21: Cyriack, whose grandsire on the royal bench": "Cyriack, whose grandsire on the royal bench       Of British Themis, with no mean applause,       Pronounced, and in his volumes taught, our laws,       Which others at their bar so often wrench, Today deep thoughts resolve with me to drench       In mirth that after no repenting draws;       Let Euclid rest, and Archimedes pause,       And what the Swede intend, and what the French. To measure life learn thou betimes, and know       Toward solid good what leads the nearest way;       For other things mild Heaven a time ordains, And disapproves that care, though wise in show,       That with superfluous burden loads the day,       And, when God sends a cheerful hour, refrains.",
        "L'Allegro": "Hence loathed Melancholy, Of Cerberus, and blackest Midnight born, In Stygian cave forlorn,       'Mongst horrid shapes, and shrieks, and sights unholy; Find out some uncouth cell,       Where brooding Darkness spreads his jealous wings, And the night-raven sings;       There under ebon shades, and low-brow'd rocks, As ragged as thy locks,       In dark Cimmerian desert ever dwell. But come thou goddess fair and free, In heav'n yclep'd Euphrosyne, And by men, heart-easing Mirth, Whom lovely Venus at a birth With two sister Graces more To Ivy-crowned Bacchus bore; Or whether (as some sager sing) The frolic wind that breathes the spring, Zephyr, with Aurora playing, As he met her once a-Maying, There on beds of violets blue, And fresh-blown roses wash'd in dew, Fill'd her with thee, a daughter fair, So buxom, blithe, and debonair. Haste thee nymph, and bring with thee Jest and youthful Jollity, Quips and cranks, and wanton wiles, Nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles, Such as hang on Hebe's cheek, And love to live in dimple sleek; Sport that wrinkled Care derides, And Laughter holding both his sides. Come, and trip it as ye go On the light fantastic toe, And in thy right hand lead with thee, The mountain-nymph, sweet Liberty; And if I give thee honour due, Mirth, admit me of thy crew To live with her, and live with thee, In unreproved pleasures free; To hear the lark begin his flight, And singing startle the dull night, From his watch-tower in the skies, Till the dappled dawn doth rise; Then to come in spite of sorrow, And at my window bid good-morrow, Through the sweet-briar, or the vine, Or the twisted eglantine; While the cock with lively din, Scatters the rear of darkness thin, And to the stack, or the barn door, Stoutly struts his dames before; Oft list'ning how the hounds and horn Cheerly rouse the slumb'ring morn, From the side of some hoar hill, Through the high wood echoing shrill. Sometime walking, not unseen, By hedge-row elms, on hillocks green, Right against the eastern gate, Where the great Sun begins his state, Rob'd in flames, and amber light, The clouds in thousand liveries dight. While the ploughman near at hand, Whistles o'er the furrow'd land, And the milkmaid singeth blithe, And the mower whets his scythe, And every shepherd tells his tale Under the hawthorn in the dale. Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures Whilst the landskip round it measures, Russet lawns, and fallows gray, Where the nibbling flocks do stray; Mountains on whose barren breast The labouring clouds do often rest; Meadows trim with daisies pied, Shallow brooks, and rivers wide. Towers, and battlements it sees Bosom'd high in tufted trees, Where perhaps some beauty lies, The cynosure of neighbouring eyes. Hard by, a cottage chimney smokes, From betwixt two aged oaks, Where Corydon and Thyrsis met, Are at their savoury dinner set Of herbs, and other country messes, Which the neat-handed Phyllis dresses; And then in haste her bow'r she leaves, With Thestylis to bind the sheaves; Or if the earlier season lead To the tann'd haycock in the mead. Sometimes with secure delight The upland hamlets will invite, When the merry bells ring round, And the jocund rebecks sound To many a youth, and many a maid, Dancing in the chequer'd shade; And young and old come forth to play On a sunshine holiday, Till the live-long daylight fail; Then to the spicy nut-brown ale, With stories told of many a feat, How Faery Mab the junkets eat, She was pinch'd and pull'd she said, And he by friar's lanthorn led, Tells how the drudging goblin sweat, To earn his cream-bowl duly set, When in one night, ere glimpse of morn, His shadowy flail hath thresh'd the corn That ten day-labourers could not end; Then lies him down, the lubber fiend, And stretch'd out all the chimney's length, Basks at the fire his hairy strength; And crop-full out of doors he flings, Ere the first cock his matin rings. Thus done the tales, to bed they creep, By whispering winds soon lull'd asleep. Tower'd cities please us then, And the busy hum of men, Where throngs of knights and barons bold, In weeds of peace high triumphs hold, With store of ladies, whose bright eyes Rain influence, and judge the prize Of wit, or arms, while both contend To win her grace, whom all commend. There let Hymen oft appear In saffron robe, with taper clear, And pomp, and feast, and revelry, With mask, and antique pageantry; Such sights as youthful poets dream On summer eves by haunted stream. Then to the well-trod stage anon, If Jonson's learned sock be on, Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child, Warble his native wood-notes wild. And ever against eating cares, Lap me in soft Lydian airs, Married to immortal verse, Such as the meeting soul may pierce In notes with many a winding bout Of linked sweetness long drawn out, With wanton heed, and giddy cunning, The melting voice through mazes running, Untwisting all the chains that tie The hidden soul of harmony; That Orpheus' self may heave his head From golden slumber on a bed Of heap'd Elysian flow'rs, and hear Such strains as would have won the ear Of Pluto, to have quite set free His half-regain'd Eurydice. These delights if thou canst give, Mirth, with thee I mean to live.",
        "Il Penseroso": "Hence vain deluding Joys,       The brood of Folly without father bred, How little you bested,       Or fill the fixed mind with all your toys; Dwell in some idle brain,       And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess, As thick and numberless       As the gay motes that people the sunbeams, Or likest hovering dreams,       The fickle pensioners of Morpheus' train. But hail thou goddess, sage and holy, Hail divinest Melancholy, Whose saintly visage is too bright To hit the sense of human sight; And therefore to our weaker view, O'er-laid with black, staid Wisdom's hue; Black, but such as in esteem, Prince Memnon's sister might beseem, Or that starr'd Ethiop queen that strove To set her beauty's praise above The sea nymphs, and their powers offended. Yet thou art higher far descended, Thee bright-hair'd Vesta long of yore, To solitary Saturn bore; His daughter she (in Saturn's reign, Such mixture was not held a stain) Oft in glimmering bow'rs and glades He met her, and in secret shades Of woody Ida's inmost grove, While yet there was no fear of Jove. Come pensive nun, devout and pure, Sober, stedfast, and demure, All in a robe of darkest grain, Flowing with majestic train, And sable stole of cypress lawn, Over thy decent shoulders drawn. Come, but keep thy wonted state, With ev'n step, and musing gait, And looks commercing with the skies, Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes: There held in holy passion still, Forget thyself to marble, till With a sad leaden downward cast, Thou fix them on the earth as fast. And join with thee calm Peace, and Quiet, Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet, And hears the Muses in a ring, Aye round about Jove's altar sing. And add to these retired Leisure, That in trim gardens takes his pleasure; But first, and chiefest, with thee bring Him that yon soars on golden wing, Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne, The cherub Contemplation; And the mute Silence hist along, 'Less Philomel will deign a song, In her sweetest, saddest plight, Smoothing the rugged brow of night, While Cynthia checks her dragon yoke, Gently o'er th' accustom'd oak. Sweet bird that shunn'st the noise of folly, Most musical, most melancholy! Thee, chauntress, oft the woods among, I woo to hear thy even-song; And missing thee, I walk unseen On the dry smooth-shaven green, To behold the wand'ring Moon, Riding near her highest noon, Like one that had been led astray Through the heav'ns wide pathless way; And oft, as if her head she bow'd, Stooping through a fleecy cloud. Oft on a plat of rising ground, I hear the far-off curfew sound, Over some wide-water'd shore, Swinging slow with sullen roar; Or if the air will not permit, Some still removed place will fit, Where glowing embers through the room Teach light to counterfeit a gloom, Far from all resort of mirth, Save the cricket on the hearth, Or the bellman's drowsy charm, To bless the doors from nightly harm. Or let my lamp at midnight hour, Be seen in some high lonely tow'r, Where I may oft out-watch the Bear, With thrice great Hermes, or unsphere The spirit of Plato, to unfold What worlds, or what vast regions hold The immortal mind that hath forsook Her mansion in this fleshly nook: And of those daemons that are found In fire, air, flood, or under ground, Whose power hath a true consent With planet, or with element. Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy In sceptr'd pall come sweeping by, Presenting Thebes', or Pelop's line, Or the tale of Troy divine, Or what (though rare) of later age, Ennobled hath the buskin'd stage. But, O sad Virgin, that thy power Might raise Musaeus from his bower, Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing Such notes as, warbled to the string, Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek, And made Hell grant what love did seek. Or call up him that left half told The story of Cambuscan bold, Of Camball, and of Algarsife, And who had Canace to wife, That own'd the virtuous ring and glass, And of the wond'rous horse of brass, On which the Tartar king did ride; And if aught else, great bards beside, In sage and solemn tunes have sung, Of tourneys and of trophies hung, Of forests, and enchantments drear, Where more is meant than meets the ear. Thus, Night, oft see me in thy pale career, Till civil-suited Morn appear, Not trick'd and frounc'd as she was wont, With the Attic boy to hunt, But kerchief'd in a comely cloud, While rocking winds are piping loud, Or usher'd with a shower still, When the gust hath blown his fill, Ending on the rustling leaves, With minute-drops from off the eaves. And when the Sun begins to fling His flaring beams, me, goddess, bring To arched walks of twilight groves, And shadows brown that Sylvan loves, Of pine, or monumental oak, Where the rude axe with heaved stroke, Was never heard the nymphs to daunt, Or fright them from their hallow'd haunt. There in close covert by some brook, Where no profaner eye may look, Hide me from Day's garish eye, While the bee with honied thigh, That at her flow'ry work doth sing, And the waters murmuring With such consort as they keep, Entice the dewy-feather'd sleep; And let some strange mysterious dream, Wave at his wings, in airy stream Of lively portraiture display'd, Softly on my eye-lids laid. And as I wake, sweet music breathe Above, about, or underneath, Sent by some spirit to mortals good, Or th' unseen Genius of the wood.           But let my due feet never fail To walk the studious cloister's pale, And love the high embowed roof, With antique pillars massy proof, And storied windows richly dight, Casting a dim religious light. There let the pealing organ blow, To the full-voic'd quire below, In service high, and anthems clear, As may with sweetness, through mine ear, Dissolve me into ecstasies, And bring all Heav'n before mine eyes. And may at last my weary age Find out the peaceful hermitage, The hairy gown and mossy cell, Where I may sit and rightly spell Of every star that Heav'n doth shew, And every herb that sips the dew; Till old experience do attain To something like prophetic strain. These pleasures, Melancholy, give, And I with thee will choose to live.",
        "Lycidas": "Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once more Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere, I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude, And with forc'd fingers rude Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year. Bitter constraint and sad occasion dear Compels me to disturb your season due; For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime, Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer. Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme. He must not float upon his wat'ry bier Unwept, and welter to the parching wind, Without the meed of some melodious tear.        Begin then, Sisters of the sacred well That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring; Begin, and somewhat loudly sweep the string. Hence with denial vain and coy excuse! So may some gentle muse With lucky words favour my destin'd urn, And as he passes turn And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud!        For we were nurs'd upon the self-same hill, Fed the same flock, by fountain, shade, and rill; Together both, ere the high lawns appear'd Under the opening eyelids of the morn, We drove afield, and both together heard What time the gray-fly winds her sultry horn, Batt'ning our flocks with the fresh dews of night, Oft till the star that rose at ev'ning bright Toward heav'n's descent had slop'd his westering wheel. Meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute, Temper'd to th'oaten flute; Rough Satyrs danc'd, and Fauns with clov'n heel, From the glad sound would not be absent long; And old Damaetas lov'd to hear our song.        But O the heavy change now thou art gone, Now thou art gone, and never must return! Thee, Shepherd, thee the woods and desert caves, With wild thyme and the gadding vine o'ergrown, And all their echoes mourn. The willows and the hazel copses green Shall now no more be seen Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays. As killing as the canker to the rose, Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze, Or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear When first the white thorn blows: Such, Lycidas, thy loss to shepherd's ear.        Where were ye, Nymphs, when the remorseless deep Clos'd o'er the head of your lov'd Lycidas? For neither were ye playing on the steep Where your old bards, the famous Druids, lie, Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high, Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream. Ay me! I fondly dream Had ye bin there'--for what could that have done? What could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore, The Muse herself, for her enchanting son, Whom universal nature did lament, When by the rout that made the hideous roar His gory visage down the stream was sent, Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore?        Alas! what boots it with incessant care To tend the homely, slighted shepherd's trade, And strictly meditate the thankless Muse? Were it not better done, as others use, To sport with Amaryllis in the shade, Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair? Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise (That last infirmity of noble mind) To scorn delights and live laborious days; But the fair guerdon when we hope to find, And think to burst out into sudden blaze, Comes the blind Fury with th'abhorred shears, And slits the thin-spun life. \"But not the praise,\" Phoebus replied, and touch'd my trembling ears; \"Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil, Nor in the glistering foil Set off to th'world, nor in broad rumour lies, But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes And perfect witness of all-judging Jove; As he pronounces lastly on each deed, Of so much fame in Heav'n expect thy meed.\"        O fountain Arethuse, and thou honour'd flood, Smooth-sliding Mincius, crown'd with vocal reeds, That strain I heard was of a higher mood. But now my oat proceeds, And listens to the Herald of the Sea, That came in Neptune's plea. He ask'd the waves, and ask'd the felon winds, \"What hard mishap hath doom'd this gentle swain?\" And question'd every gust of rugged wings That blows from off each beaked promontory. They knew not of his story; And sage Hippotades their answer brings, That not a blast was from his dungeon stray'd; The air was calm, and on the level brine Sleek Panope with all her sisters play'd. It was that fatal and perfidious bark, Built in th'eclipse, and rigg'd with curses dark, That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.        Next Camus, reverend sire, went footing slow, His mantle hairy, and his bonnet sedge, Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge Like to that sanguine flower inscrib'd with woe. \"Ah! who hath reft,\" quoth he, \"my dearest pledge?\" Last came, and last did go, The Pilot of the Galilean lake; Two massy keys he bore of metals twain (The golden opes, the iron shuts amain). He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake: \"How well could I have spar'd for thee, young swain, Enow of such as for their bellies' sake Creep and intrude, and climb into the fold? Of other care they little reck'ning make Than how to scramble at the shearers' feast And shove away the worthy bidden guest. Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold A sheep-hook, or have learn'd aught else the least That to the faithful herdman's art belongs! What recks it them? What need they? They are sped; And when they list their lean and flashy songs Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw, The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed, But, swoll'n with wind and the rank mist they draw, Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread; Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw Daily devours apace, and nothing said, But that two-handed engine at the door Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more\".        Return, Alpheus: the dread voice is past That shrunk thy streams; return, Sicilian Muse, And call the vales and bid them hither cast Their bells and flow'rets of a thousand hues. Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use Of shades and wanton winds, and gushing brooks, On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks, Throw hither all your quaint enamel'd eyes, That on the green turf suck the honied showers And purple all the ground with vernal flowers. Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies, The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine, The white pink, and the pansy freak'd with jet, The glowing violet, The musk-rose, and the well attir'd woodbine, With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head, And every flower that sad embroidery wears; Bid amaranthus all his beauty shed, And daffadillies fill their cups with tears, To strew the laureate hearse where Lycid lies. For so to interpose a little ease, Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise. Ay me! Whilst thee the shores and sounding seas Wash far away, where'er thy bones are hurl'd; Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides, Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world, Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied, Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old, Where the great vision of the guarded mount Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold: Look homeward Angel now, and melt with ruth; And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth.        Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more, For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the wat'ry floor; So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed, And yet anon repairs his drooping head, And tricks his beams, and with new spangled ore Flames in the forehead of the morning sky: So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high Through the dear might of him that walk'd the waves; Where, other groves and other streams along, With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves, And hears the unexpressive nuptial song, In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love. There entertain him all the Saints above, In solemn troops, and sweet societies, That sing, and singing in their glory move, And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes. Now, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more: Henceforth thou art the Genius of the shore, In thy large recompense, and shalt be good To all that wander in that perilous flood.        Thus sang the uncouth swain to th'oaks and rills, While the still morn went out with sandals gray; He touch'd the tender stops of various quills, With eager thought warbling his Doric lay; And now the sun had stretch'd out all the hills, And now was dropp'd into the western bay; At last he rose, and twitch'd his mantle blue: To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new.",

But this is got by casting pearl to hogs, That bawl for freedom in their senseless mood,        And still revolt when truth would set them free.

Yet I argue not        Against Heav'n's hand or will, not bate a jot        Of heart or hope, but still bear up and steer Right onward. What supports me, dost thou ask?        The conscience, friend, to have lost them overplied        In liberty's defence, my noble task, Of which all Europe talks from side to side.

        "Paradise Regain'd: Book 1 (1671 version)": "I Who e're while the happy Garden sung, By one mans disobedience lost, now sing Recover'd Paradise to all mankind, By one mans firm obedience fully tri'd Through all temptation, and the Tempter foil'd In all his wiles, defeated and repuls't, And Eden rais'd in the wast Wilderness.    Thou Spirit who ledst this glorious Eremite Into the Desert, his Victorious Field Against the Spiritual Foe, and broughtst him thence By proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire, As thou art wont, my prompted Song else mute, And bear through highth or depth of natures bounds With prosperous wing full summ'd to tell of deeds Above Heroic, though in secret done, And unrecorded left through many an Age, Worthy t'have not remain'd so long unsung.    Now had the great Proclaimer with a voice More awful then the sound of Trumpet, cri'd Repentance, and Heavens Kingdom nigh at hand To all Baptiz'd: to his great Baptism flock'd With aw the Regions round, and with them came From Nazareth the Son of Joseph deem'd To the flood Jordan, came as then obscure, Unmarkt, unknown; but him the Baptist soon Descri'd, divinely warn'd, and witness bore As to his worthier, and would have resign'd To him his Heavenly Office, nor was long His witness unconfirm'd: on him baptiz'd Heaven open'd, and in likeness of a Dove The Spirit descended, while the Fathers voice From Heav'n pronounc'd him his beloved Son. That heard the Adversary, who roving still About the world, at that assembly fam'd Would not be last, and with the voice divine Nigh Thunder-struck, th' exalted man, to whom Such high attest was giv'n, a while survey'd With wonder, then with envy fraught and rage Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air To Councel summons all his mighty Peers, Within thick Clouds and dark ten-fold involv'd, A gloomy Consistory; and them amidst With looks agast and sad he thus bespake.    O ancient Powers of Air and this wide world, For much more willingly I mention Air, This our old Conquest, then remember Hell Our hated habitation; well ye know How many Ages, as the years of men, This Universe we have possest, and rul'd In manner at our will th' affairs of Earth, Since Adam and his facil consort Eve Lost Paradise deceiv'd by me, though since With dread attending when that fatal wound Shall be inflicted by the Seed of Eve Upon my head, long the decrees of Heav'n Delay, for longest time to him is short; And now too soon for us the circling hours This dreaded time have compast, wherein we Must bide the stroak of that long threatn'd wound, At least if so we can, and by the head Broken be not intended all our power To be infring'd, our freedom and our being. In this fair Empire won of Earth and Air; For this ill news I bring, the Womans seed Destin'd to this, is late of woman born, His birth to our just fear gave no small cause, But his growth now to youths full flowr, displaying All vertue, grace and wisdom to atchieve Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear. Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim His coming, is sent Harbinger, who all Invites, and in the Consecrated stream Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so Purified to receive him pure, or rather To do him honour as their King; all come, And he himself among them was baptiz'd, Not thence to be more pure, but to receive The testimony of Heaven, that who he is Thenceforth the Nations may not doubt; I saw The Prophet do him reverence, on him rising Out of the water, Heav'n above the Clouds Unfold her Crystal Dores, thence on his head A perfect Dove descend, what e're it meant, And out of Heav'n the Sov'raign voice I heard, This is my Son belov'd, in him am pleas'd. His Mother then is mortal, but his Sire, He who obtains the Monarchy of Heav'n, And what will he not do to advance his Son? His first-begot we know, and sore have felt, When his fierce thunder drove us to the deep; Who this is we must learn, for man he seems In all his lineaments, though in his face The glimpses of his Fathers glory shine. Ye see our danger on the utmost edge Of hazard, which admits no long debate, But must with something sudden be oppos'd, Not force, but well couch't fraud, well woven snares, E're in the head of Nations he appear Their King, their Leader, and Supream on Earth. I, when no other durst, sole undertook The dismal expedition to find out And ruine Adam, and the exploit perform'd Successfully; a calmer voyage now Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once Induces best to hope of like success.    He ended, and his words impression left Of much amazement to th' infernal Crew, Distracted and surpriz'd with deep dismay At these sad tidings; but no time was then For long indulgence to their fears or grief: Unanimous they all commit the care And management of this main enterprize To him their great Dictator, whose attempt At first against mankind so well had thriv'd In Adam's overthrow, and led thir march From Hell's deep-vaulted Den to dwell in light, Regents and Potentates, and Kings, yea gods Of many a pleasant Realm and Province wide. So to the Coast of Jordan he directs His easie steps; girded with snaky wiles, Where he might likeliest find this new-declar'd, This man of men, attested Son of God, Temptation and all guile on him to try; So to subvert whom he suspected rais'd To end his Raign on Earth so long enjoy'd: But contrary unweeting he fulfill'd The purpos'd Counsel pre-ordain'd and fixt Of the most High, who in full frequence bright Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake.    Gabriel this day by proof thou shalt behold, Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth With man or mens affairs, how I begin To verifie that solemn message late, On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure In Galilee, that she should bear a Son Great in Renown, and call'd the Son of God; Then toldst her doubting how these things could be To her a Virgin, that on her should come The Holy Ghost, and the power of the highest O're-shadow her: this man born and now up-grown, To shew him worthy of his birth divine And high prediction, henceforth I expose To Satan; let him tempt and now assay His utmost subtilty, because he boasts And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng Of his Apostasie; he might have learnt Less over-weening, since he fail'd in Job, Whose constant perseverance overcame Whate're his cruel malice could invent. He now shall know I can produce a man Of female Seed, far abler to resist All his sollicitations, and at length All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell, Winning by Conquest what the first man lost By fallacy surpriz'd.   But first I mean To exercise him in the Wilderness, There he shall first lay down the rudiments Of his great warfare, e're I send him forth To conquer Sin and Death the two grand foes, By Humiliation and strong Sufferance: His weakness shall o'recome Satanic strength And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh; That all the Angels and AEtherial Powers, They now, and men hereafter may discern, From what consummate vertue I have chose This perfect Man, by merit call'd my Son, To earn Salvation for the Sons of men.    So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven Admiring stood a space, then into Hymns Burst forth, and in Celestial measures mov'd, Circling the Throne and Singing, while the hand Sung with the voice, and this the argument.    Victory and Triumph to the Son of God Now entring his great duel, not of arms, But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles. The Father knows the Son; therefore secure Ventures his filial Vertue, though untri'd, Against whate're may tempt, whate're seduce, Allure, or terrifie, or undermine. Be frustrate all ye stratagems of Hell, And devilish machinations come to nought.    So they in Heav'n their Odes and Vigils tun'd: Mean while the Son of God, who yet some days Lodg'd in Bethabara where John baptiz'd, Musing and much revolving in his brest, How best the mighty work he might begin Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first Publish his God-like office now mature, One day forth walk'd alone, the Spirit leading; And his deep thoughts, the better to converse With solitude, till far from track of men, Thought following thought, and step by step led on, He entred now the bordering Desert wild, And with dark shades and rocks environ'd round, His holy Meditations thus persu'd.    O what a multitude of thoughts at once Awakn'd in me swarm, while I consider What from within I feel my self, and hear What from without comes often to my ears, Ill sorting with my present state compar'd. When I was yet a child, no childish play To me was pleasing, all my mind was set Serious to learn and know, and thence to do What might be publick good; my self I thought Born to that end, born to promote all truth, All righteous things: therefore above my years, The Law of God I read, and found it sweet, Made it my whole delight, and in it grew To such perfection, that e're yet my age Had measur'd twice six years, at our great Feast I went into the Temple, there to hear The Teachers of our Law, and to propose What might improve my knowledge or their own; And was admir'd by all, yet this not all To which my Spirit aspir'd, victorious deeds Flam'd in my heart, heroic acts, one while To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke, Then to subdue and quell o're all the earth Brute violence and proud Tyrannick pow'r, Till truth were freed, and equity restor'd: Yet held it more humane, more heavenly first By winning words to conquer willing hearts, And make perswasion do the work of fear; At least to try, and teach the erring Soul Not wilfully mis-doing, but unware Misled; the stubborn only to destroy. These growing thoughts my Mother soon perceiving By words at times cast forth inly rejoyc'd, And said to me apart, high are thy thoughts O Son, but nourish them and let them soar To what highth sacred vertue and true worth Can raise them, though above example high; By matchless Deeds express thy matchless Sire. For know, thou art no Son of mortal man, Though men esteem thee low of Parentage, Thy Father is the Eternal King, who rules All Heaven and Earth, Angels and Sons of men, A messenger from God fore-told thy birth Conceiv'd in me a Virgin, he fore-told Thou shouldst be great and sit on David's Throne, And of thy Kingdom there should be no end. At thy Nativity a glorious Quire Of Angels in the fields of Bethlehem sung To Shepherds watching at their folds by night, And told them the Messiah now was born, Where they might see him, and to thee they came; Directed to the Manger where thou lais't, For in the Inn was left no better room: A Star, not seen before in Heaven appearing Guided the Wise Men thither from the East, To honour thee with Incense, Myrrh, and Gold, By whose bright course led on they found the place, Affirming it thy Star new grav'n in Heaven, By which they knew thee King of Israel born. Just Simeon and Prophetic Anna, warn'd By Vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake Before the Altar and the vested Priest, Like things of thee to all that present stood. This having heard, strait I again revolv'd The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ Concerning the Messiah, to our Scribes Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake I am; this chiefly, that my way must lie Through many a hard assay even to the death, E're I the promis'd Kingdom can attain, Or work Redemption for mankind, whose sins Full weight must be transferr'd upon my head. Yet neither thus disheartn'd or dismay'd, The time prefixt I waited, when behold The Baptist, (of whose birth I oft had heard, Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come Before Messiah and his way prepare. I as all others to his Baptism came, Which I believ'd was from above; but he Strait knew me, and with loudest voice proclaim'd Me him (for it was shew'n him so from Heaven) Me him whose Harbinger he was; and first Refus'd on me his Baptism to confer, As much his greater, and was hardly won; But as I rose out of the laving stream, Heaven open'd her eternal doors, from whence The Spirit descended on me like a Dove, And last the sum of all, my Father's voice, Audibly heard from Heav'n, pronounc'd me his, Me his beloved Son, in whom alone He was well pleas'd; by which I knew the time Now full, that I no more should live obscure, But openly begin, as best becomes The Authority which I deriv'd from Heaven. And now by some strong motion I am led Into this Wilderness, to what intent I learn not yet, perhaps I need not know; For what concerns my knowledge God reveals.    So spake our Morning Star then in his rise, And looking round on every side beheld A pathless Desert, dusk with horrid shades; The way he came not having mark'd, return Was difficult, by humane steps untrod; And he still on was led, but with such thoughts Accompanied of things past and to come Lodg'd in his breast, as well might recommend Such Solitude before choicest Society. Full forty days he pass'd, whether on hill Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night Under the covert of some ancient Oak, Or Cedar, to defend him from the dew, Or harbour'd in one Cave, is not reveal'd; Nor tasted humane food, nor hunger felt Till those days ended, hunger'd then at last Among wild Beasts: they at his sight grew mild, Nor sleeping him nor waking harm'd, his walk The fiery Serpent fled, and noxious Worm, The Lion and fierce Tiger glar'd aloof. But now an aged man in Rural weeds, Following, as seem'd, the quest of some stray Ewe, Or wither'd sticks to gather; which might serve Against a Winters day when winds blow keen, To warm him wet return'd from field at Eve, He saw approach, who first with curious eye Perus'd him, then with words thus utt'red spake.    Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place So far from path or road of men, who pass In Troop or Caravan, for single none Durst ever, who return'd, and dropt not here His Carcass, pin'd with hunger and with droughth? I ask the rather, and the more admire, For that to me thou seem'st the man, whom late Our new baptizing Prophet at the Ford Of Jordan honour'd so, and call'd thee Son Of God; I saw and heard, for we sometimes Who dwell this wild, constrain'd by want, come forth To Town or Village nigh (nighest is far) Where ought we hear, and curious are to hear, What happ'ns new; Fame also finds us out.    To whom the Son of God. Who brought me hither Will bring me hence, no other Guide I seek.    By Miracle he may, reply'd the Swain, What other way I see not, for we here Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inur'd More then the Camel, and to drink go far, Men to much misery and hardship born; But if thou be the Son of God, Command That out of these hard stones be made thee bread; So shalt thou save thy self and us relieve With Food, whereof we wretched seldom taste.    He ended, and the Son of God reply'd. Think'st thou such force in Bread? is it not written (For I discern thee other then thou seem'st) Man lives not by Bread only, but each Word Proceeding from the mouth of God; who fed Our Fathers here with Manna; in the Mount Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank, And forty days Eliah without food Wandred this barren waste, the same I now. Why dost thou then suggest to me distrust, Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art?    Whom thus answer'd th' Arch Fiend now undisguis'd. 'Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate, Who leagu'd with millions more in rash revolt Kept not my happy Station, but was driv'n With them from bliss to the bottomless deep, Yet to that hideous place not so confin'd By rigour unconniving, but that oft Leaving my dolorous Prison I enjoy Large liberty to round this Globe of Earth, Or range in th' Air, nor from the Heav'n of Heav'ns Hath he excluded my resort sometimes. I came among the Sons of God, when he Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job To prove him, and illustrate his high worth; And when to all his Angels he propos'd To draw the proud King Ahab into fraud That he might fall in Ramoth, they demuring, I undertook that office, and the tongues Of all his flattering Prophets glibb'd with lyes To his destruction, as I had in charge. For what he bids I do; though I have lost Much lustre of my native brightness, lost To be belov'd of God, I have not lost To love, at least contemplate and admire What I see excellent in good, or fair, Or vertuous, I should so have lost all sense. What can be then less in me then desire To see thee and approach thee, whom I know Declar'd the Son of God, to hear attent Thy wisdom, and behold thy God-like deeds? Men generally think me much a foe To all mankind: why should I? they to me Never did wrong or violence, by them I lost not what I lost, rather by them I gain'd what I have gain'd, and with them dwell Copartner in these Regions of the World, If not disposer; lend them oft my aid, Oft my advice by presages and signs, And answers, oracles, portents and dreams, Whereby they may direct their future life. Envy they say excites me, thus to gain Companions of my misery and wo. At first it may be; but long since with wo Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof, That fellowship in pain divides not smart, Nor lightens aught each mans peculiar load. Small consolation then, were Man adjoyn'd: This wounds me most (what can it less) that Man, Man fall'n shall be restor'd, I never more.    To whom our Saviour sternly thus reply'd. Deservedly thou griev'st, compos'd of lyes From the beginning, and in lies wilt end; Who boast'st release from Hell, and leave to come Into the Heav'n of Heavens; thou com'st indeed, As a poor miserable captive thrall, Comes to the place where he before had sat Among the Prime in Splendour, now depos'd, Ejected, emptyed, gaz'd, unpityed, shun'd, A spectacle of ruin or of scorn To all the Host of Heaven; the happy place Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy, Rather inflames thy torment, representing Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable, So never more in Hell then when in Heaven. But thou art serviceable to Heaven's King. Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites? What but thy malice mov'd thee to misdeem Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him With all inflictions, but his patience won? The other service was thy chosen task, To be a lyer in four hundred mouths; For lying is thy sustenance, thy food. Yet thou pretend'st to truth; all Oracles By thee are giv'n, and what confest more true Among the Nations? that hath been thy craft, By mixing somewhat true to vent more lyes. But what have been thy answers, what but dark Ambiguous and with double sense deluding, Which they who ask'd have seldom understood, And not well understood as good not known? Who ever by consulting at thy shrine Return'd the wiser, or the more instruct To flye or follow what concern'd him most, And run not sooner to his fatal snare? For God hath justly giv'n the Nations up To thy Delusions; justly, since they fell Idolatrous, but when his purpose is Among them to declare his Providence To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth, But from him or his Angels President In every Province, who themselves disdaining To approach thy Temples, give thee in command What to the smallest tittle thou shalt say To thy Adorers; thou with trembling fear, Or like a Fawning Parasite obey'st; Then to thy self ascrib'st the truth fore-told. But this thy glory shall be soon retrench'd; No more shalt thou by oracling abuse The Gentiles; henceforth Oracles are ceast, And thou no more with Pomp and Sacrifice Shalt be enquir'd at Delphos or elsewhere, At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute. God hath now sent his living Oracle Into the World, to teach his final will, And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell In pious Hearts, an inward Oracle To all truth requisite for men to know.    So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend, Though inly stung with anger and disdain, Dissembl'd, and this Answer smooth return'd.    Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke, And urg'd me hard with doings, which not will But misery hath rested from me; where Easily canst thou find one miserable, And not inforc'd oft-times to part from truth; If it may stand him more in stead to lye, Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure? But thou art plac't above me, thou art Lord; From thee I can and must submiss endure Check or reproof, and glad to scape so quit. Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk, Smooth on the tongue discourst, pleasing to th' ear, And tuneable as Silvan Pipe or Song; What wonder then if I delight to hear Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire Vertue, who follow not her lore: permit me To hear thee when I come (since no man comes) And talk at least, though I despair to attain. Thy Father, who is holy, wise and pure, Suffers the Hypocrite or Atheous Priest To tread his Sacred Courts, and minister About his Altar, handling holy things, Praying or vowing, and vouchsaf'd his voice To Balaam Reprobate, a Prophet yet Inspir'd; disdain not such access to me.    To whom our Saviour with unalter'd brow. Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope, I bid not or forbid; do as thou find'st Permission from above; thou canst not more.    He added not; and Satan bowing low His gray dissimulation, disappear'd Into thin Air diffus'd: for now began Night with her sullen wing to double-shade The Desert, Fowls in thir clay nests were couch't; And now wild Beasts came forth the woods to roam.",
        "Paradise Regain'd: Book 2 (1671 version)": "MEan while the new-baptiz'd, who yet remain'd At Jordan with the Baptist, and had seen Him whom they heard so late expresly call'd Jesus Messiah Son of God declar'd, And on that high Authority had believ'd, And with him talkt, and with him lodg'd, I mean Andrew and Simon, famous after known With others though in Holy Writ not nam'd, Now missing him thir joy so lately found, So lately found, and so abruptly gone, Began to doubt, and doubted many days, And as the days increas'd, increas'd thir doubt: Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn, And for a time caught up to God, as once Moses was in the Mount, and missing long; And the great Thisbite who on fiery wheels Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come. Therefore as those young Prophets then with care Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these Nigh to Bethabara; in Jerico The City of Palms, AEnon, and Salem Old, Machaerus and each Town or City wall'd On this side the broad lake Genezaret, Or in Perea, but return'd in vain. Then on the bank of Jordan, by a Creek: Where winds with Reeds, and Osiers whisp'ring play Plain Fishermen, no greater men them call, Close in a Cottage low together got Thir unexpected loss and plaints out breath'd. Alas, from what high hope to what relapse Unlook'd for are we fall'n, our eyes beheld Messiah certainly now come, so long Expected of our Fathers; we have heard His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth, Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand, The Kingdom shall to Israel be restor'd: Thus we rejoyc'd, but soon our joy is turn'd Into perplexity and new amaze: For whither is he gone, what accident Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire After appearance, and again prolong Our expectation?   God of Israel, Send thy Messiah forth, the time is come; Behold the Kings of the Earth how they oppress Thy chosen, to what highth thir pow'r unjust They have exalted, and behind them cast All fear of thee, arise and vindicate Thy Glory, free thy people from thir yoke, But let us wait; thus far he hath perform'd, Sent his Anointed, and to us reveal'd him, By his great Prophet, pointed at and shown, In publick, and with him we have convers'd; Let us be glad of this, and all our fears Lay on his Providence; he will not fail Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall, Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence, Soon we shall see our hope, our joy return.    Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume To find whom at the first they found unsought: But to his Mother Mary, when she saw Others return'd from Baptism, not her Son, Nor left at Jordan, tydings of him none; Within her brest, though calm; her brest though pure, Motherly cares and fears got head, and rais'd Some troubl'd thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad.    O what avails me now that honour high To have conceiv'd of God, or that salute Hale highly favour'd, among women blest; While I to sorrows am no less advanc't, And fears as eminent, above the lot Of other women, by the birth I bore, In such a season born when scarce a Shed Could be obtain'd to shelter him or me From the bleak air; a Stable was our warmth, A Manger his, yet soon enforc't to flye Thence into Egypt, till the Murd'rous King Were dead, who sought his life, and missing fill'd With Infant blood the streets of Bethlehem; From Egypt home return'd, in Nazareth Hath been our dwelling many years, his life Private, unactive, calm, contemplative, Little suspicious to any King; but now Full grown to Man, acknowledg'd, as I hear, By John the Baptist, and in publick shown, Son own'd from Heaven by his Father's voice; I look't for some great change; to Honour? no, But trouble, as old Simeon plain fore-told, That to the fall and rising he should be Of many in Israel, and to a sign Spoken against, that through my very Soul A sword shall pierce, this is my favour'd lot, My Exaltation to Afflictions high; Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest; I will not argue that, nor will repine. But where delays he now? some great intent Conceals him: when twelve years he scarce had seen, I lost him, but so found, as well I saw He could not lose himself; but went about His Father's business; what he meant I mus'd, Since understand; much more his absence now Thus long to some great purpose he obscures. But I to wait with patience am inur'd; My heart hath been a store-house long of things And sayings laid up, portending strange events.    Thus Mary pondering oft, and oft to mind Recalling what remarkably had pass'd Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts Meekly compos'd awaited the fulfilling: The while her Son tracing the Desert wild, Sole but with holiest Meditations fed, Into himself descended, and at once All his great work to come before him set; How to begin, how to accomplish best His end of being on Earth, and mission high: For Satan with slye preface to return Had left him vacant, and with speed was gon Up to the middle Region of thick Air, Where all his Potentates in Council sate; There without sign of boast, or sign of joy, Sollicitous and blank he thus began.    Princes, Heavens antient Sons, AEthereal Thrones, Demonian Spirits now, from the Element Each of his reign allotted, rightlier call'd, Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath, So may we hold our place and these mild seats Without new trouble; such an Enemy Is ris'n to invade us, who no less Threat'ns then our expulsion down to Hell; I, as I undertook, and with the vote Consenting in full frequence was impowr'd, Have found him, view'd him, tasted him, but find Far other labour to be undergon Then when I dealt with Adam first of Men, Though Adam by his Wives allurement fell, However to this Man inferior far, If he be Man by Mothers side at least, With more then humane gifts from Heaven adorn'd, Perfections absolute, Graces divine, And amplitude of mind to greatest Deeds. Therefore I am return'd, lest confidence Of my success with Eve in Paradise Deceive ye to perswasion over-sure Of like succeeding here; I summon all Rather to be in readiness, with hand Or counsel to assist; lest I who erst Thought none my equal, now be over-match'd.    So spake the old Serpent doubting, and from all With clamour was assur'd thir utmost aid At his command; when from amidst them rose Belial the dissolutest Spirit that fell, The sensuallest, and after Asmodai The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advis'd.    Set women in his eye and in his walk, Among daughters of men the fairest found; Many are in each Region passing fair As the noon Skie; more like to Goddesses Then Mortal Creatures, graceful and discreet, Expert in amorous Arts, enchanting tongues Perswasive, Virgin majesty with mild And sweet allay'd, yet terrible to approach, Skill'd to retire, and in retiring draw Hearts after them tangl'd in Amorous Nets. Such object hath the power to soft'n and tame Severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow, Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve, Draw out with credulous desire, and lead At will the manliest, resolutest brest, As the Magnetic hardest Iron draws. Women, when nothing else, beguil'd the heart Of wisest Solomon, and made him build, And made him bow to the Gods of his Wives.    To whom quick answer Satan thus return'd. Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st All others by thy self; because of old Thou thy self doat'st on womankind, admiring Thir shape, thir colour, and attractive grace, None are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys. Before the Flood thou with thy lusty Crew, False titl'd Sons of God, roaming the Earth Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men, And coupl'd with them, and begot a race. Have we not seen, or by relation heard, In Courts and Regal Chambers how thou lurk'st, In Wood or Grove by mossie Fountain side, In Valley or Green Meadow to way-lay Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene, Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa, Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more Too long, then lay'st thy scapes on names ador'd, Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan, Satyr, or Fawn, or Silvan?   But these haunts Delight not all; among the Sons of Men, How many have with a smile made small account Of beauty and her lures, easily scorn'd All her assaults, on worthier things intent? Remember that Pellean Conquerour, A youth, how all the Beauties of the East He slightly view'd, and slightly over-pass'd; How hee sirnam'd of Africa dismiss'd In his prime youth the fair Iberian maid. For Solomon he liv'd at ease, and full Of honour, wealth, high fare, aim'd not beyond Higher design then to enjoy his State; Thence to the bait of Women lay expos'd; But he whom we attempt is wiser far Then Solomon, of more exalted mind, Made and set wholly on the accomplishment Of greatest things; what woman will you find, Though of this Age the wonder and the fame, On whom his leisure will vouchsafe an eye Of fond desire? or should she confident, As sitting Queen ador'd on Beauties Throne, Descend with all her winning charms begirt To enamour, as the Zone of Venus once Wrought that effect on Jove, so Fables tell; How would one look from his Majestick brow Seated as on the top of Vertues hill, Discount'nance her despis'd, and put to rout All her array; her female pride deject, Or turn to reverent awe? for Beauty stands In the admiration only of weak minds Led captive; cease to admire, and all her Plumes Fall flat and shrink into a trivial toy, At every sudden slighting quite abasht: Therefore with manlier objects we must try His constancy, with such as have more shew Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise; Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreck'd; Or that which only seems to satisfie Lawful desires of Nature, not beyond; And now I know he hungers where no food Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness; The rest commit to me, I shall let pass No advantage, and his strength as oft assay.    He ceas'd, and heard thir grant in loud acclaim; Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band Of Spirits likest to himself in guile To be at hand, and at his beck appear, If cause were to unfold some active Scene Of various persons each to know his part; Then to the Desert takes with these his flight; Where still from shade to shade the Son of God After forty days fasting had remain'd, Now hungring first, and to himself thus said.    Where will this end? four times ten days I have pass'd Wandring this woody maze, and humane food Nor tasted, nor had appetite; that Fast To Vertue I impute not, or count part Of what I suffer here; if Nature need not, Or God support Nature without repast Though needing, what praise is it to endure? But now I feel I hunger, which declares, Nature hath need of what she asks; yet God Can satisfie that need some other way, Though hunger still remain: so it remain Without this bodies wasting, I content me, And from the sting of Famine fear no harm, Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts that feed Mee hungring more to do my Fathers will.    It was the hour of night, when thus the Son Commun'd in silent walk, then laid him down Under the hospitable covert nigh Of Trees thick interwoven; there he slept, And dream'd, as appetite is wont to dream, Of meats and drinks, Natures refreshment sweet; Him thought, he by the Brook of Cherith stood And saw the Ravens with their horny beaks Food to Elijah bringing Even and Morn, Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought: He saw the Prophet also how he fled Into the Desert, and how there he slept Under a Juniper; then how awakt, He found his Supper on the coals prepar'd, And by the Angel was bid rise and eat, And eat the second time after repose, The strength whereof suffic'd him forty days; Sometimes that with Elijah he partook, Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse. Thus wore out night, and now the Herald Lark Left his ground-nest, high towring to descry The morns approach, and greet her with his Song: As lightly from his grassy Couch up rose Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream, Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting wak'd. Up to a hill anon his steps he rear'd, From whose high top to ken the prospect round, If Cottage were in view, Sheep-cote or Herd; But Cottage, Herd or Sheep-cote none he saw, Only in a bottom saw a pleasant Grove, With chaunt of tuneful Birds resounding loud; Thither he bent his way, determin'd there To rest at noon, and entr'd soon the shade High rooft and walks beneath, and alleys brown That open'd in the midst a woody Scene, Natures own work it seem'd (Nature taught Art) And to a Superstitious eye the haunt Of Wood-Gods and Wood-Nymphs; he view'd it round, When suddenly a man before him stood, Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad, As one in City, or Court, or Palace bred, And with fair speech these words to him address'd.    With granted leave officious I return, But much more wonder that the Son of God In this wild solitude so long should bide Of all things destitute, and well I know, Not without hunger.   Others of some note, As story tells, have trod this Wilderness; The Fugitive Bond-woman with her Son Out cast Nebaioth, yet found he relief By a providing Angel; all the race Of Israel here had famish'd, had not God Rain'd from Heaven Manna, and that Prophet bold Native of Thebes wandring here was fed Twice by a voice inviting him to eat. Of thee these forty days none hath regard, Forty and more deserted here indeed.    To whom thus Jesus; what conclud'st thou hence? They all had need, I as thou seest have none.    How hast thou hunger then? Satan reply'd, Tell me if Food were now before thee set, Would'st thou not eat? Thereafter as I like The giver, answer'd Jesus. Why should that Cause thy refusal, said the subtle Fiend, Hast thou not right to all Created things, Owe not all Creatures by just right to thee Duty and Service, nor to stay till bid, But tender all their power? nor mention I Meats by the Law unclean, or offer'd first To Idols, those young Daniel could refuse; Nor proffer'd by an Enemy, though who Would scruple that, with want opprest? behold Nature asham'd, or better to express, Troubl'd that thou shouldst hunger, hath purvey'd From all the Elements her choicest store To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord With honour, only deign to sit and eat.    He spake no dream, for as his words had end, Our Saviour lifting up his eyes beheld In ample space under the broadest shade A Table richly spred, in regal mode, With dishes pill'd, and meats of noblest sort And savour, Beasts of chase, or Fowl of game, In pastry built, or from the spit, or boyl'd, Gris-amber-steam'd; all Fish from Sea or Shore, Freshet, or purling Brook, of shell or fin, And exquisitest name, for which was drain'd Pontus and Lucrine Bay, and Afric Coast. Alas how simple, to these Cates compar'd, Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve! And at a stately side-board by the wine That fragrant smell diffus'd, in order stood Tall stripling youths rich clad, of fairer hew Then Ganymed or Hylas, distant more Under the Trees now trip'd, now solemn stood Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn, And Ladies of th' Hesperides, that seem'd Fairer then feign'd of old, or fabl'd since Of Fairy Damsels met in Forest wide By Knights of Logres, or of Lyones, Lancelot or Pelleas, or Pellenore, And all the while Harmonious Airs were heard Of chiming strings, or charming pipes and winds Of gentlest gale Arabian odors fann'd From their soft wings, and Flora's earliest smells. Such was the Splendour, and the Tempter now His invitation earnestly renew'd.    What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat? These are not Fruits forbidden, no interdict Defends the touching of these viands pure, Thir taste no knowledge works, at least of evil, But life preserves, destroys life's enemy, Hunger, with sweet restorative delight. All these are Spirits of Air, and Woods, and Springs, Thy gentle Ministers, who come to pay Thee homage, and acknowledge thee thir Lord: What doubt'st thou Son of God? sit down and eat.    To whom thus Jesus temperately reply'd: Said'st thou not that to all things I had right? And who withholds my pow'r that right to use? Shall I receive by gift what of my own, When and where likes me best, I can command? I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou, Command a Table in this Wilderness, And call swift flights of Angels ministrant Array'd in Glory on my cup to attend: Why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence, In vain, where no acceptance it can find, And with my hunger what has thou to do? Thy pompous Delicacies I contemn, And count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles.    To whom thus answer'd Satan malecontent: That I have also power to give thou seest, If of that pow'r I bring thee voluntary What I might have bestow'd on whom I pleas'd, And rather opportunely in this place Chose to impart to thy apparent need, Why shouldst thou not accept it? but I see What I can do or offer is suspect; Of these things others quickly will dispose Whose pains have earn'd the far fet spoil. With that Both Table and Provision vanish'd quite With sound of Harpies wings, and Talons heard; Only the importune Tempter still remain'd, And with these words his temptation pursu'd.    By hunger, that each other Creature tames, Thou art not to be harm'd, therefore not mov'd; Thy temperance invincible besides, For no allurement yields to appetite, And all thy heart is set on high designs, High actions; but wherewith to be atchiev'd? Great acts require great means of enterprise, Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth, A Carpenter thy Father known, thy self Bred up in poverty and streights at home; Lost in a Desert here and hunger-bit: Which way or from what hope dost thou aspire To greatness? whence Authority deriv'st, What Followers, what Retinue canst thou gain, Or at thy heels the dizzy Multitude, Longer then thou canst feed them on thy cost? Money brings Honour, Friends, Conquest, and Realms; What rais'd Antipater the Edomite, And his Son Herod plac'd on Juda's Throne; (Thy throne) but gold that got him puissant friends? Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive, Get Riches first, get Wealth, and Treasure heap, Not difficult, if thou hearken to me, Riches are mine, Fortune is in my hand; They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain, While Virtue, Valour, Wisdom sit in want.    To whom thus Jesus patiently reply'd; Yet Wealth without these three is impotent, To gain dominion or to keep it gain'd. Witness those antient Empires of the Earth, In highth of all thir flowing wealth dissolv'd: But men endu'd with these have oft attain'd In lowest poverty to highest deeds; Gideon and Jephtha, and the Shepherd lad, Whose off-spring on the Throne of Juda sat So many Ages, and shall yet regain That seat, and reign in Israel without end. Among the Heathen, (for throughout the World To me is not unknown what hath been done Worthy of Memorial) canst thou not remember Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus? For I esteem those names of men so poor Who could do mighty things, and could contemn Riches though offer'd from the hand of Kings. And what in me seems wanting, but that I May also in this poverty as soon Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more? Extol not Riches then, the toyl of Fools, The wise mans cumbrance if not snare, more apt To slacken Virtue, and abate her edge, Then prompt her to do aught may merit praise. What if with like aversion I reject Riches and Realms; yet not for that a Crown, Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns, Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights To him who wears the Regal Diadem, When on his shoulders each mans burden lies; For therein stands the office of a King, His Honour, Vertue, Merit and chief Praise, That for the Publick all this weight he bears. Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules Passions, Desires, and Fears, is more a King; Which every wise and vertuous man attains: And who attains not, ill aspires to rule Cities of men or head-strong Multitudes, Subject himself to Anarchy within, Or lawless passions in him which he serves. But to guide Nations in the way of truth By saving Doctrine, and from errour lead To know, and knowing worship God aright, Is yet more Kingly, this attracts the Soul, Governs the inner man, the nobler part, That other o're the body only reigns, And oft by force, which to a generous mind So reigning can be no sincere delight. Besides to give a Kingdom hath been thought Greater and nobler done, and to lay down Far more magnanimous, then to assume. Riches are needless then, both for themselves, And for thy reason why they should be sought, To gain a Scepter, oftest better miss't.",
        "Paradise Regain'd: Book 3 (1671 version)": "SO spake the Son of God, and Satan stood A while as mute confounded what to say, What to reply, confuted and convinc't Of his weak arguing, and fallacious drift; At length collecting all his Serpent wiles, With soothing words renew'd, him thus accosts.    I see thou know'st what is of use to know, What best to say canst say, to do canst do; Thy actions to thy words accord, thy words To thy large heart give utterance due, thy heart Conteins of good, wise, just, the perfect shape. Should Kings and Nations from thy mouth consult, Thy Counsel would be as the Oracle Urim and Thummim, those oraculous gems On Aaron's breast: or tongue of Seers old Infallible; or wert thou sought to deeds That might require th' array of war, thy skill Of conduct would be such, that all the world Could not sustain thy Prowess, or subsist In battel, though against thy few in arms. These God-like Vertues wherefore dost thou hide? Affecting private life, or more obscure In savage Wilderness, wherefore deprive All Earth her wonder at thy acts, thy self The fame and glory, glory the reward That sole excites to high attempts the flame Of most erected Spirits, most temper'd pure AEtherial, who all pleasures else despise, All treasures and all gain esteem as dross, And dignities and powers all but the highest? Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe, the Son Of Macedonian Philip had e're these Won Asia and the Throne of Cyrus held At his dispose, young Scipio had brought down The Carthaginian pride, young Pompey quell'd The Pontic King and in triumph had rode. Yet years, and to ripe years judgment mature, Quench not the thirst of glory, but augment. Great Julius, whom now all the world admires The more he grew in years, the more inflam'd With glory, wept that he had liv'd so long Inglorious: but thou yet art not too late.    To whom our Saviour calmly thus reply'd. Thou neither dost perswade me to seek wealth For Empires sake, nor Empire to affect For glories sake by all thy argument. For what is glory but the blaze of fame, The peoples praise, if always praise unmixt? And what the people but a herd confus'd, A miscellaneous rabble, who extol Things vulgar, & well weigh'd, scarce worth the praise, They praise and they admire they know not what; And know not whom, but as one leads the other; And what delight to be by such extoll'd, To live upon thir tongues and be thir talk, Of whom to be disprais'd were no small praise? His lot who dares be singularly good. Th' intelligent among them and the wise Are few, and glory scarce of few is rais'd. This is true glory and renown, when God Looking on the Earth, with approbation marks The just man, and divulges him through Heaven To all his Angels, who with true applause Recount his praises; thus he did to Job, When to extend his fame through Heaven & Earth, As thou to thy reproach mayst well remember, He ask'd thee, hast thou seen my servant Job? Famous he was in Heaven, on Earth less known; Where glory is false glory, attributed To things not glorious, men not worthy of fame. They err who count it glorious to subdue By Conquest far and wide, to over-run Large Countries, and in field great Battels win, Great Cities by assault: what do these Worthies, But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave Peaceable Nations, neighbouring, or remote, Made Captive, yet deserving freedom more Then those thir Conquerours, who leave behind Nothing but ruin wheresoe're they rove, And all the flourishing works of peace destroy, Then swell with pride, and must be titl'd Gods, Great Benefactors of mankind, Deliverers, Worship't with Temple, Priest and Sacrifice; One is the Son of Jove, of Mars the other, Till Conquerour Death discover them scarce men, Rowling in brutish vices, and deform'd, Violent or shameful death thir due reward. But if there be in glory aught of good, It may by means far different be attain'd Without ambition, war, or violence; By deeds of peace, by wisdom eminent, By patience, temperance; I mention still Him whom thy wrongs with Saintly patience born, Made famous in a Land and times obscure; Who names not now with honour patient Job? Poor Socrates (who next more memorable?) By what he taught and suffer'd for so doing, For truths sake suffering death unjust, lives now Equal in fame to proudest Conquerours. Yet if for fame and glory aught be done, Aught suffer'd; if young African for fame His wasted Country freed from Punic rage, The deed becomes unprais'd, the man at least, And loses, though but verbal, his reward. Shall I seek glory then, as vain men seek Oft not deserv'd?   I seek not mine, but his Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I am.    To whom the Tempter murmuring thus reply'd. Think not so slight of glory; therein least Resembling thy great Father: he seeks glory, And for his glory all things made, all things Orders and governs, nor content in Heaven By all his Angels glorifi'd, requires Glory from men, from all men good or bad, Wise or unwise, no difference, no exemption; Above all Sacrifice, or hallow'd gift Glory he requires, and glory he receives Promiscuous from all Nations, Jew, or Greek, Or Barbarous, nor exception hath declar'd; From us his foes pronounc't glory he exacts.    To whom our Saviour fervently reply'd. And reason; since his word all things produc'd, Though chiefly not for glory as prime end, But to shew forth his goodness, and impart His good communicable to every soul Freely; of whom what could he less expect Then glory and benediction, that is thanks, The slightest, easiest, readiest recompence From them who could return him nothing else, And not returning that would likeliest render Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy? Hard recompence, unsutable return For so much good, so much beneficence. But why should man seek glory? who of his own Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs But condemnation, ignominy, and shame? Who for so many benefits receiv'd Turn'd recreant to God, ingrate and false, And so of all true good himself despoil'd, Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take That which to God alone of right belongs; Yet so much bounty is in God, such grace, That who advance his glory, not thir own, Them he himself to glory will advance.    So spake the Son of God; and here again Satan had not to answer, but stood struck With guilt of his own sin, for he himself Insatiable of glory had lost all, Yet of another Plea bethought him soon.    Of glory as thou wilt, said he, so deem, Worth or not worth the seeking, let it pass: But to a Kingdom thou art born, ordain'd To sit upon thy Father David's Throne; By Mothers side thy Father, though thy right Be now in powerful hands, that will not part Easily from possession won with arms; Judaea now and all the promis'd land Reduc't a Province under Roman yoke, Obeys Tiberius; nor is always rul'd With temperate sway; oft have they violated The Temple, oft the Law with foul affronts, Abominations rather, as did once Antiochus: and think'st thou to regain Thy right by sitting still or thus retiring? So did not Machabeus: he indeed Retir'd unto the Desert, but with arms; And o're a mighty King so oft prevail'd, That by strong hand his Family obtain'd, Though Priests, the Crown, and David's Throne usurp'd, With Modin and her Suburbs once content. If Kingdom move thee not, let move thee Zeal, And Duty; Zeal and Duty are not slow; But on Occasions forelock watchful wait. They themselves rather are occasion best, Zeal of thy Fathers house, Duty to free Thy Country from her Heathen servitude; So shalt thou best fullfil, best verifie The Prophets old, who sung thy endless raign, The happier raign the sooner it begins, Raign then; what canst thou better do the while?    To whom our Saviour answer thus return'd. All things are best fullfil'd in their due time, And time there is for all things, Truth hath said: If of my raign Prophetic Writ hath told, That it shall never end, so when begin The Father in his purpose hath decreed, He in whose hand all times and seasons roul. What if he hath decreed that I shall first Be try'd in humble state, and things adverse, By tribulations, injuries, insults, Contempts, and scorns, and snares, and violence, Suffering, abstaining, quietly expecting Without distrust or doubt, that he may know What I can suffer, how obey? who best Can suffer, best can do; best reign, who first Well hath obey'd; just tryal e're I merit My exaltation without change or end. But what concerns it thee when I begin My everlasting Kingdom, why art thou Sollicitous, what moves thy inquisition? Know'st thou not that my rising is thy fall, And my promotion will be thy destruction?    To whom the Tempter inly rackt reply'd. Let that come when it comes; all hope is lost Of my reception into grace; what worse? For where no hope is left, is left no fear; If there be worse, the expectation more Of worse torments me then the feeling can. I would be at the worst; worst is my Port, My harbour and my ultimate repose, The end I would attain, my final good. My error was my error and my crime My crime; whatever for it self condemn'd, And will alike be punish'd; whether thou Raign or raign not; though to that gentle brow Willingly I could flye, and hope thy raign, From that placid aspect and meek regard, Rather then aggravate my evil state, Would stand between me and thy Fathers ire, (Whose ire I dread more then the fire of Hell) A shelter and a kind of shading cool Interposition, as a summers cloud. If I then to the worst that can be hast, Why move thy feet so slow to what is best, Happiest both to thy self and all the world, That thou who worthiest art should'st be thir King? Perhaps thou linger'st in deep thoughts detain'd Of the enterprize so hazardous and high; No wonder, for though in thee be united What of perfection can in man be found, Or human nature can receive, consider Thy life hath yet been private, most part spent At home, scarce view'd the Gallilean Towns, And once a year Jerusalem, few days Short sojourn; and what thence could'st thou observe? The world thou hast not seen, much less her glory, Empires, and Monarchs, and thir radiant Courts, Best school of best experience, quickest in sight In all things that to greatest actions lead. The wisest, unexperienc't, will be ever Timorous and loth, with novice modesty, (As he who seeking Asses found a Kingdom) Irresolute, unhardy, unadventrous: But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit Those rudiments, and see before thine eyes The Monarchies of the Earth, thir pomp and state, Sufficient introduction to inform Thee, of thy self so apt, in regal Arts, And regal Mysteries; that thou may'st know How best their opposition to withstand.    With that (such power was giv'n him then) he took The Son of God up to a Mountain high. It was a Mountain at whose verdant feet A spatious plain out stretch't in circuit wide Lay pleasant; from his side two rivers flow'd, Th' one winding, the other strait and left between Fair Champain with less rivers interveind, Then meeting joyn'd thir tribute to the Sea: Fertil of corn the glebe, of oyl and wine, With herds the pastures throng'd, with flocks the hills, Huge Cities and high towr'd, that well might seem The seats of mightiest Monarchs, and so large The Prospect was, that here and there was room For barren desert fountainless and dry. To this high mountain top the Tempter brought Our Saviour, and new train of words began.    Well have we speeded, and o're hill and dale, Forest and field, and flood, Temples and Towers Cut shorter many a league; here thou behold'st Assyria and her Empires antient bounds, Araxes and the Caspian lake, thence on As far as Indus East, Euphrates West, And oft beyond; to South the Persian Bay, And inaccessible the Arabian drouth: Here Ninevee, of length within her wall Several days journey, built by Ninus old, Of that first golden Monarchy the seat, And seat of Salmanassar, whose success Israel in long captivity still mourns; There Babylon the wonder of all tongues, As antient, but rebuilt by him who twice Judah and all thy Father David's house Led captive, and Jerusalem laid waste, Till Cyrus set them free; Persepolis His City there thou seest, and Bactra there; Ecbatana her structure vast there shews, And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates, There Susa by Choaspes, amber stream, The drink of none but Kings; of later fame Built by Emathian, or by Parthian hands, The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and there Artaxata, Teredon, Tesiphon, Turning with easie eye thou may'st behold. All these the Parthian, now some Ages past, By great Arsaces led, who founded first That Empire, under his dominion holds From the luxurious Kings of Antioch won. And just in time thou com'st to have a view Of his great power; for now the Parthian King In Ctesiphon hath gather'd all his Host Against the Scythian, whose incursions wild Have wasted Sogdiana; to her aid He marches now in hast; see, though from far, His thousands, in what martial equipage They issue forth, Steel Bows, and Shafts their arms Of equal dread in flight, or in pursuit; All Horsemen, in which fight they most excel; See how in warlike muster they appear, In Rhombs and wedges, and half moons, and wings.    He look't and saw what numbers numberless The City gates out powr'd, light armed Troops In coats of Mail and military pride; In Mail thir horses clad, yet fleet and strong, Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice Of many Provinces from bound to bound; From Arachosia, from Candaor East, And Margiana to the Hyrcanian cliffs Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales, From Atropatia and the neighbouring plains Of Adiabene, Media, and the South Of Susiana to Balsara's hav'n. He saw them in thir forms of battell rang'd, How quick they wheel'd, and flying behind them shot Sharp sleet of arrowie showers against the face Of thir pursuers, and overcame by flight; The field all iron cast a gleaming brown, Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor on each horn, Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight; Chariots or Elephants endorst with Towers Of Archers, nor of labouring Pioners A multitude with Spades and Axes arm'd To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill, Or where plain was raise hill, or over-lay With bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke; Mules after these, Camels and Dromedaries, And Waggons fraught with Utensils of war. Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp, When Agrican with all his Northern powers Besieg'd Albracca, as Romances tell; The City of Gallaphrone, from thence to win The fairest of her Sex Angelica His daughter, sought by many Prowest Knights, Both Paynim, and the Peers of Charlemane. Such and so numerous was thir Chivalrie; At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presum'd, And to our Saviour thus his words renew'd.    That thou may'st know I seek not to engage Thy Vertue, and not every way secure On no slight grounds thy safety; hear, and mark To what end I have brought thee hither and shewn All this fair sight; thy Kingdom though foretold By Prophet or by Angel, unless thou Endeavour, as thy Father David did, Thou never shalt obtain; prediction still In all things, and all men, supposes means, Without means us'd, what it predicts revokes. But say thou wer't possess'd of David's Throne By free consent of all, none opposite, Samaritan or Jew; how could'st thou hope Long to enjoy it quiet and secure, Between two such enclosing enemies Roman and Parthian? therefore one of these Thou must make sure thy own, the Parthian first By my advice, as nearer and of late Found able by invasion to annoy Thy country, and captive lead away her Kings Antigonus, and old Hyrcanus bound, Maugre the Roman: it shall be my task To render thee the Parthian at dispose; Chuse which thou wilt by conquest or by league. By him thou shalt regain, without him not, That which alone can truly reinstall thee In David's royal seat, his true Successour, Deliverance of thy brethren, those ten Tribes Whose off-spring in his Territory yet serve In Habor, and among the Medes dispers't, Ten Sons of Jacob, two of Joseph lost Thus long from Israel; serving as of old Thir Fathers in the land of Egypt serv'd, This offer sets before thee to deliver. These if from servitude thou shalt restore To thir inheritance, then, nor till then, Thou on the Throne of David in full glory, From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond Shalt raign, and Rome or Caesar not need fear.    To whom our Saviour answer'd thus unmov'd. Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm, And fragile arms, much instrument of war Long in preparing, soon to nothing brought, Before mine eyes thou hast set; and in my ear Vented much policy, and projects deep Of enemies, of aids, battels and leagues, Plausible to the world, to me worth naught. Means I must use thou say'st, prediction else Will unpredict and fail me of the Throne: My time I told thee, (and that time for thee Were better farthest off) is not yet come,; When that comes think not thou to find me slack On my part aught endeavouring, or to need Thy politic maxims, or that cumbersome Luggage of war there shewn me, argument Of human weakness rather then of strength. My brethren, as thou call'st them; those Ten Tribes I must deliver, if I mean to raign David's true heir, and his full Scepter sway To just extent over all Israel's Sons; But whence to thee this zeal, where was it then For Israel, or for David, or his Throne, When thou stood'st up his Tempter to the pride Of numbring Israel, which cost the lives Of threescore and ten thousand Israelites By three days Pestilence? such was thy zeal To Israel then, the same that now to me. As for those captive Tribes, themselves were they Who wrought their own captivity, fell off From God to worship Calves, the Deities Of Egypt, Baal next and Ashtaroth, And all the Idolatries of Heathen round, Besides thir other worse then heathenish crimes; Nor in the land of their captivity Humbled themselves, or penitent besought The God of their fore-fathers; but so dy'd Impenitent, and left a race behind Like to themselves, distinguishable scarce From Gentils, but by Circumcision vain, And God with Idols in their worship joyn'd. Should I of these the liberty regard, Who freed, as to their antient Patrimony, Unhumbl'd, unrepentant, unreform'd, Headlong would follow; and to thir Gods perhaps Of Bethel and of Dan? no, let them serve Thir enemies, who serve Idols with God. Yet he at length, time to himself best known, Remembring Abraham by some wond'rous call May bring them back repentant and sincere, And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood, While to their native land with joy they hast, As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft, When to the promis'd land thir Fathers pass'd; To his due time and providence I leave them.    So spake Israel's true King, and to the Fiend Made answer meet, that made void all his wiles. So fares it when with truth falshood contends.",
        "Paradise Regain'd: Book 4 (1671 version)": "PErplex'd and troubl'd at his bad success The Tempter stood, nor had what to reply, Discover'd in his fraud, thrown from his hope, So oft, and the perswasive Rhetoric That sleek't his tongue, and won so much on Eve, So little here, nay lost; but Eve was Eve, This far his over-match, who self deceiv'd And rash, before-hand had no better weigh'd The strength he was to cope with, or his own: But as a man who had been matchless held In cunning, over-reach't where least he thought, To salve his credit, and for very spight Still will be tempting him who foyls him still, And never cease, though to his shame the more; Or as a swarm of flies in vintage time, About the wine-press where sweet moust is powr'd, Beat off, returns as oft with humming sound; Or surging waves against a solid rock, Though all to shivers dash't, the assault renew, Vain battry, and in froth or bubbles end; So Satan, whom repulse upon repulse Met ever; and to shameful silence brought, Yet gives not o're though desperate of success, And his vain importunity pursues. He brought our Saviour to the western side Of that high mountain, whence he might behold Another plain, long but in bredth not wide; Wash'd by the Southern Sea, and on the North To equal length back'd with a ridge of hills That screen'd the fruits of the earth and seats of men From cold Septentrion blasts, thence in the midst Divided by a river, of whose banks On each side an Imperial City stood, With Towers and Temples proudly elevate On seven small Hills, with Palaces adorn'd, Porches and Theatres, Baths, Aqueducts, Statues and Trophees, and Triumphal Arcs, Gardens and Groves presented to his eyes, Above the highth of Mountains interpos'd. By what strange Parallax or Optic skill Of vision multiplyed through air, or glass Of Telescope, were curious to enquire: And now the Tempter thus his silence broke.    The City which thou seest no other deem Then great and glorious Rome, Queen of the Earth So far renown'd, and with the spoils enricht Of Nations; there the Capitol thou seest Above the rest lifting his stately head On the Tarpeian rock, her Cittadel Impregnable, and there Mount Palatine The Imperial Palace, compass huge, and high The Structure, skill of noblest Architects, With gilded battlements, conspicuous far, Turrets and Terrases, and glittering Spires. Many a fair Edifice besides, more like Houses of Gods (so well I have dispos'd My Aerie Microscope) thou may'st behold Outside and inside both, pillars and roofs Carv'd work, the hand of fam'd Artificers In Cedar, Marble, Ivory or Gold. Thence to the gates cast round thine eye, and see What conflux issuing forth, or entring in, Pretors, Proconsuls to thir Provinces Hasting or on return, in robes of State; Lictors and rods the ensigns of thir power, Legions and Cohorts, turmes of horse and wings: Or Embassies from Regions far remote In various habits on the Appian road, Or on the AEmilian, some from farthest South, Syene, and where the shadow both way falls, Meroe Nilotic Isle, and more to West, The Realm of Bocchus to the Black-moor Sea; From the Asian Kings and Parthian among these, From India and the golden Chersoness, And utmost Indian Isle Taprobane, Dusk faces with white silken Turbants wreath'd: From Gallia, Gades, and the Brittish West, Germans and Scythians, and Sarmatians North Beyond Danubius to the Tauric Pool. All Nations now to Rome obedience pay, To Rome's great Emperour, whose wide domain In ample Territory, wealth and power, Civility of Manners, Arts, and Arms, And long Renown thou justly may'st prefer Before the Parthian; these two Thrones except, The rest are barbarous, and scarce worth the sight, Shar'd among petty Kings too far remov'd; These having shewn thee, I have shewn thee all The Kingdoms of the world, and all thir glory. This Emperour hath no Son, and now is old, Old, and lascivious, and from Rome retir'd To Capreae an Island small but strong On the Campanian shore, with purpose there His horrid lusts in private to enjoy, Committing to a wicked Favourite All publick cares, and yet of him suspicious, Hated of all, and hating; with what ease Indu'd with Regal Vertues as thou art, Appearing, and beginning noble deeds, Might'st thou expel this monster from his Throne Now made a stye, and in his place ascending A victor, people free from servile yoke? And with my help thou may'st; to me the power Is given, and by that right I give it thee. Aim therefore at no less then all the world, Aim at the highest, without the highest attain'd Will be for thee no sitting, or not long On David's Throne, be propheci'd what will.    To whom the Son of God unmov'd reply'd. Nor doth this grandeur and majestic show Of luxury, though call'd magnificence, More then of arms before, allure mine eye, Much less my mind; though thou should'st add to tell Thir sumptuous gluttonies, and gorgeous feasts On Cittron tables or Atlantic stone; (For I have also heard, perhaps have read) Their wines of Setia, Cales, and Falerne, Chios and Creet, and how they quaff in Gold, Crystal and Myrrhine cups imboss'd with Gems And studs of Pearl, to me should'st tell who thirst And hunger still: then Embassies thou shew'st From Nations far and nigh; what honour that, But tedious wast of time to sit and hear So many hollow complements and lies, Outlandish flatteries? then proceed'st to talk Of the Emperour, how easily subdu'd, How gloriously; I shall, thou say'st, expel A brutish monster: what if I withal Expel a Devil who first made him such? Let his tormenter Conscience find him out, For him I was not sent, nor yet to free That people victor once, now vile and base, Deservedly made vassal, who once just, Frugal, and mild, and temperate, conquer'd well, But govern ill the Nations under yoke, Peeling thir Provinces, exhausted all By lust and rapine; first ambitious grown Of triumph that insulting vanity; Then cruel, by thir sports to blood enur'd Of fighting beasts, and men to beasts expos'd, Luxurious by thir wealth, and greedier still, And from the daily Scene effeminate. What wise and valiant man would seek to free These thus degenerate, by themselves enslav'd, Or could of inward slaves make outward free? Know therefore when my season comes to sit On David's Throne, it shall be like a tree Spreading and over-shadowing all the Earth, Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash All Monarchies besides throughout the world, And of my Kingdom there shall be no end: Means there shall be to this, but what the means, Is not for thee to know, nor me to tell.    To whom the Tempter impudent repli'd. I see all offers made by me how slight Thou valu'st, because offer'd, and reject'st: Nothing will please the difficult and nice, Or nothing more then still to contradict: On the other side know also thou, that I On what I offer set as high esteem, Nor what I part with mean to give for naught; All these which in a moment thou behold'st, The Kingdoms of the world to thee I give; For giv'n to me, I give to whom I please, No trifle; yet with this reserve, not else, On this condition, if thou wilt fall down, And worship me as thy superior Lord, Easily done, and hold them all of me; For what can less so great a gift deserve?    Whom thus our Saviour answer'd with disdain. I never lik'd thy talk, thy offers less, Now both abhor, since thou hast dar'd to utter The abominable terms, impious condition; But I endure the time, till which expir'd, Thou hast permission on me.   It is written The first of all Commandments, Thou shalt worship The Lord thy God, and only him shalt serve; And dar'st thou to the Son of God propound To worship thee accurst, now more accurst For this attempt bolder then that on Eve, And more blasphemous? which expect to rue. The Kingdoms of the world to thee were giv'n, Permitted rather, and by thee usurp't, Other donation none thou canst produce: If given, by whom but by the King of Kings, God over all supreme? if giv'n to thee, By thee how fairly is the Giver now Repaid?   But gratitude in thee is lost Long since.   Wert thou so void of fear or shame, As offer them to me the Son of God, To me my own, on such abhorred pact, That I fall down and worship thee as God? Get thee behind me; plain thou now appear'st That Evil one, Satan for ever damn'd.    To whom the Fiend with fear abasht reply'd. Be not so sore offended, Son of God; Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men, If I to try whether in higher sort Then these thou bear'st that title, have propos'd What both from Men and Angels I receive, Tetrarchs of fire, air, flood, and on the earth Nations besides from all the quarter'd winds, God of this world invok't and world beneath; Who then thou art, whose coming is foretold To me so fatal, me it most concerns. The tryal hath indamag'd thee no way, Rather more honour left and more esteem; Me naught advantag'd, missing what I aim'd. Therefore let pass, as they are transitory, The Kingdoms of this world; I shall no more Advise thee, gain them as thou canst, or not. And thou thy self seem'st otherwise inclin'd Then to a worldly Crown, addicted more To contemplation and profound dispute, As by that early action may be judg'd, When slipping from thy Mothers eye thou went'st Alone into the Temple; there was found Among the gravest Rabbies disputant On points and questions fitting Moses Chair, Teaching not taught; the childhood shews the man, As morning shews the day.   Be famous then By wisdom; as thy Empire must extend, So let extend thy mind o're all the world, In knowledge, all things in it comprehend, All knowledge is not couch't in Moses Law, The Pentateuch or what the Prophets wrote, The Gentiles also know, and write, and teach To admiration, led by Natures light; And with the Gentiles much thou must converse, Ruling them by perswasion as thou mean'st, Without thir learning how wilt thou with them, Or they with thee hold conversation meet? How wilt thou reason with them, how refute Thir Idolisms, Traditions, Paradoxes? Error by his own arms is best evinc't. Look once more e're we leave this specular Mount Westward, much nearer by Southwest, behold Where on the AEgean shore a City stands Built nobly, pure the air, and light the soil, Athens the eye of Greece, Mother of Arts And Eloquence, native to famous wits Or hospitable, in her sweet recess, City or Suburban, studious walks and shades; See there the Olive Grove of Academe, Plato's retirement, where the Attic Bird Trills her thick-warbl'd notes the summer long, There flowrie hill Hymettus with the sound Of Bees industrious murmur oft invites To studious musing; there Ilissus rouls His whispering stream; within the walls then view The schools of antient Sages; his who bred Great Alexander to subdue the world, Lyceum there, and painted Stoa next: There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power Of harmony in tones and numbers hit By voice or hand, and various-measur'd verse, AEolian charms and Dorian Lyric Odes, And his who gave them breath, but higher sung, Blind Melesigenes thence Homer call'd, Whose Poem Phoebus challeng'd for his own. Thence what the lofty grave Tragoedians taught In Chorus or Iambic, teachers best Of moral prudence, with delight receiv'd In brief sententious precepts, while they treat Of fate, and chance, and change in human life; High actions, and high passions best describing: Thence to the famous Orators repair, Those antient, whose resistless eloquence Wielded at will that fierce Democratie, Shook the Arsenal and fulmin'd over Greece, To Macedon, and Artaxerxes Throne; To sage Philosophy next lend thine ear, From Heaven descended to the low-rooft house Of Socrates, see there his Tenement, Whom well inspir'd the Oracle pronounc'd Wisest of men; from whose mouth issu'd forth Mellifluous streams that water'd all the schools Of Academics old and new, with those Sirnam'd Peripatetics, and the Sect Epicurean, and the Stoic severe; These here revolve, or, as thou lik'st, at home, Till time mature thee to a Kingdom's waight; These rules will render thee a King compleat Within thy self, much more with Empire joyn'd.    To whom our Saviour sagely thus repli'd. Think not but that I know these things, or think I know them not; not therefore am I short Of knowing what I aught: he who receives Light from above, from the fountain of light, No other doctrine needs, though granted true; But these are false, or little else but dreams, Conjectures, fancies, built on nothing firm. The first and wisest of them all profess'd To know this only, that he nothing knew; The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits, A third sort doubted all things, though plain sence; Others in vertue plac'd felicity, But vertue joyn'd with riches and long life, In corporal pleasure he, and careless ease, The Stoic last in Philosophic pride, By him call'd vertue; and his vertuous man, Wise, perfect in himself, and all possessing Equal to God, oft shames not to prefer, As fearing God nor man, contemning all Wealth, pleasure, pain or torment, death and life, Which when he lists, he leaves, or boasts he can, For all his tedious talk is but vain boast, Or subtle shifts conviction to evade. Alas what can they teach, and not mislead; Ignorant of themselves, of God much more, And how the world began, and how man fell Degraded by himself, on grace depending? Much of the Soul they talk, but all awrie, And in themselves seek vertue, and to themselves All glory arrogate, to God give none, Rather accuse him under usual names, Fortune and Fate, as one regardless quite Of mortal things.   Who therefore seeks in these True wisdom, finds her not, or by delusion Far worse, her false resemblance only meets, An empty cloud.   However many books Wise men have said are wearisom; who reads Incessantly, and to his reading brings not A spirit and judgment equal or superior, (And what he brings, what needs he elsewhere seek) Uncertain and unsettl'd still remains, Deep verst in books and shallow in himself, Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys, And trifles for choice matters, worth a spunge; As Children gathering pibles on the shore. Or if I would delight my private hours With Music or with Poem, where so soon As in our native Language can I find That solace?   All our Law and Story strew'd With Hymns, our Psalms with artful terms inscrib'd, Our Hebrew Songs and Harps in Babylon, That pleas'd so well our Victors ear, declare That rather Greece from us these Arts deriv'd; Ill imitated, while they loudest sing The vices of thir Deities, and thir own In Fable, Hymn, or Song, so personating Thir Gods ridiculous, and themselves past shame. Remove their swelling Epithetes thick laid As varnish on a Harlots cheek, the rest, Thin sown with aught of profit or delight, Will far be found unworthy to compare With Sion's songs, to all true tasts excelling, Where God is prais'd aright, and Godlike men, The Holiest of Holies, and his Saints; Such are from God inspir'd, not such from thee; Unless where moral vertue is express't By light of Nature not in all quite lost. Thir Orators thou then extoll'st, as those The top of Eloquence, Statists indeed, And lovers of thir Country, as may seem; But herein to our Prophets far beneath, As men divinely taught, and better teaching The solid rules of Civil Government In thir majestic unaffected stile Then all the Oratory of Greece and Rome. In them is plainest taught, and easiest learnt, What makes a Nation happy, and keeps it so, What ruins Kingdoms, and lays Cities flat; These only with our Law best form a King.    So spake the Son of God; but Satan now Quite at a loss, for all his darts were spent, Thus to our Saviour with stern brow reply'd.    Since neither wealth, nor honour, arms nor arts, Kingdom nor Empire pleases thee, nor aught By me propos'd in life contemplative, Or active, tended on by glory, or fame, What dost thou in this World? the Wilderness For thee is fittest place, I found thee there, And thither will return thee, yet remember What I foretell thee, soon thou shalt have cause To wish thou never hadst rejected thus Nicely or cautiously my offer'd aid, Which would have set thee in short time with ease On David's Throne; or Throne of all the world, Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season, When Prophesies of thee are best fullfill'd. Now contrary, if I read aught in Heaven, Or Heav'n write aught of Fate, by what the Stars Voluminous, or single characters, In their conjunction met, give me to spell, Sorrows, and labours, opposition, hate, Attends thee, scorns, reproaches, injuries, Violence and stripes, and lastly cruel death, A Kingdom they portend thee, but what Kingdom, Real or Allegoric I discern not, Nor when, eternal sure, as without end, Without beginning; for no date prefixt Directs me in the Starry Rubric set.    So saying he took (for still he knew his power Not yet expir'd) and to the Wilderness Brought back the Son of God, and left him there, Feigning to disappear.   Darkness now rose, As day-light sunk, and brought in lowring night Her shadowy off-spring unsubstantial both, Privation meer of light and absent day. Our Saviour meek and with untroubl'd mind After his aerie jaunt, though hurried sore, Hungry and cold betook him to his rest, Wherever, under some concourse of shades Whose branching arms thick intertwind might shield From dews and damps of night his shelter'd head, But shelter'd slept in vain, for at his head The Tempter watch'd, and soon with ugly dreams Disturb'd his sleep; and either Tropic now Gan thunder, and both ends of Heav'n, the Clouds From many a horrid rift abortive pour'd Fierce rain with lightning mixt, water with fire In ruine reconcil'd: nor slept the winds Within thir stony caves, but rush'd abroad From the four hinges of the world, and fell On the vext Wilderness, whose tallest Pines, Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest Oaks Bow'd their Stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts, Or torn up sheer: ill wast thou shrouded then, O patient Son of God, yet only stoodst Unshaken; nor yet staid the terror there, Infernal Ghosts, and Hellish Furies, round Environ'd thee, some howl'd, some yell'd, some shriek'd, Some bent at thee thir fiery darts, while thou Sat'st unappall'd in calm and sinless peace. Thus pass'd the night so foul till morning fair Came forth with Pilgrim steps in amice gray; Who with her radiant finger still'd the roar Of thunder, chas'd the clouds, and laid the winds, And grisly Spectres, which the Fiend had rais'd To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire. And now the Sun with more effectual beams Had chear'd the face of Earth, and dry'd the wet From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds Who all things now behold more fresh and green, After a night of storm so ruinous, Clear'd up their choicest notes in bush and spray To gratulate the sweet return of morn; Nor yet amidst this joy and brightest morn Was absent, after all his mischief done, The Prince of darkness, glad would also seem Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came, Yet with no new device, they all were spent, Rather by this his last affront resolv'd, Desperate of better course, to vent his rage, And mad despight to be so oft repell'd. Him walking on a Sunny hill he found, Back'd on the North and West by a thick wood, Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape; And in a careless mood thus to him said.    Fair morning yet betides thee Son of God, After a dismal night; I heard the rack As Earth and Skie would mingle; but my self Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them As dangerous to the pillard frame of Heaven, Or to the Earths dark basis underneath, Are to the main as inconsiderable, And harmless, if not wholsom, as a sneeze To mans less universe, and soon are gone; Yet as being oft times noxious where they light On man, beast, plant, wastful and turbulent, Like turbulencies in the affairs of men, Over whose heads they rore, and seem to point, They oft fore-signifie and threaten ill: This Tempest at this Desert most was bent; Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell'st. Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject The perfet season offer'd with my aid To win thy destin'd seat, but wilt prolong All to the push of Fate, persue thy way Of gaining David's Throne no man knows when, For both the when and how is no where told, Thou shalt be what thou art ordain'd, no doubt; For Angels have proclaim'd it, but concealing The time and means: each act is rightliest done, Not when it must, but when it may be best. If thou observe not this, be sure to find, What I foretold thee, many a hard assay Of dangers, and adversities and pains, E're thou of Israel's Scepter get fast hold; Whereof this ominous night that clos'd thee round, So many terrors, voices, prodigies May warn thee, as a sure fore-going sign.    So talk'd he, while the Son of God went on And staid not, but in brief him answer'd thus.    Mee worse then wet thou find'st not; other harm Those terrors which thou speak'st of, did me none; I never fear'd they could, though noising loud And threatning nigh; what they can do as signs Betok'ning, or ill boding, I contemn As false portents, not sent from God, but thee; Who knowing I shall raign past thy preventing, Obtrud'st thy offer'd aid, that I accepting At least might seem to hold all power of thee, Ambitious spirit, and wouldst be thought my God, And storm'st refus'd, thinking to terrifie Mee to thy will; desist, thou art discern'd And toil'st in vain, nor me in vain molest.    To whom the Fiend now swoln with rage reply'd: Then hear, O Son of David, Virgin-born; For Son of God to me is yet in doubt, Of the Messiah I have heard foretold By all the Prophets; of thy birth at length Announc't by Gabriel with the first I knew, And of the Angelic Song in Bethlehem field, On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born. From that time seldom have I ceas'd to eye Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth, Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred; Till at the Ford of Jordan whither all Flock'd to the Baptist, I among the rest, Though not to be Baptiz'd, by voice from Heav'n Heard thee pronounc'd the Son of God belov'd. Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view And narrower Scrutiny, that I might learn In what degree or meaning thou art call'd The Son of God, which bears no single sence; The Son of God I also am, or was, And if I was, I am; relation stands; All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought In some respect far higher so declar'd. Therefore I watch'd thy footsteps from that hour, And follow'd thee still on to this wast wild; Where by all best conjectures I collect Thou art to be my fatal enemy. Good reason then, if I before-hand seek To understand my Adversary, who And what he is; his wisdom, power, intent, By parl, or composition, truce, or league To win him, or win from him what I can. And opportunity I here have had To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee Proof against all temptation as a rock Of Adamant, and as a Center, firm To the utmost of meer man both wise and good, Not more; for Honours, Riches, Kingdoms, Glory Have been before contemn'd, and may agen: Therefore to know what more thou art then man, Worth naming Son of God by voice from Heav'n, Another method I must now begin.    So saying he caught him up, and without wing Of Hippogrif bore through the Air sublime Over the Wilderness and o're the Plain; Till underneath them fair Jerusalem, The holy City lifted high her Towers, And higher yet the glorious Temple rear'd Her pile, far off appearing like a Mount Of Alabaster, top't with Golden Spires: There on the highest Pinacle he set The Son of God; and added thus in scorn:    There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright Will ask thee skill; I to thy Fathers house Have brought thee, and highest plac't, highest is best, Now shew thy Progeny; if not to stand, Cast thy self down; safely if Son of God: For it is written, He will give command Concerning thee to his Angels, in thir hands They shall up lift thee, lest at any time Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone.    To whom thus Jesus: also it is written, Tempt not the Lord thy God, he said and stood. But Satan smitten with amazement fell As when Earths Son Antaeus (to compare Small things with greatest) in Irassa strove With Joves Alcides, and oft foil'd still rose, Receiving from his mother Earth new strength, Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joyn'd, Throttl'd at length in the Air, expir'd and fell; So after many a foil the Tempter proud, Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride Fell whence he stood to see his Victor fall. And as that Theban Monster that propos'd Her riddle, and him, who solv'd it not, devour'd; That once found out and solv'd, for grief and spight Cast her self headlong from th' Ismenian steep, So strook with dread and anguish fell the Fiend, And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought Joyless triumphals of his hop't success, Ruin, and desperation, and dismay, Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God. So Satan fell and strait a fiery Globe Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh, Who on their plumy Vans receiv'd him soft From his uneasie station, and upbore As on a floating couch through the blithe Air, Then in a flowry valley set him down On a green bank, and set before him spred A table of Celestial Food, Divine, Ambrosial, Fruits fetcht from the tree of life, And from the fount of life Ambrosial drink, That soon refresh'd him wearied, and repair'd What hunger, if aught hunger had impair'd, Or thirst, and as he fed, Angelic Quires Sung Heavenly Anthems of his victory Over temptation, and the Tempter proud.    True Image of the Father whether thron'd In the bosom of bliss, and light of light Conceiving, or remote from Heaven, enshrin'd In fleshly Tabernacle, and human form, Wandring the Wilderness, whatever place, Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing The Son of God, with Godlike force indu'd Against th' Attempter of thy Fathers Throne, And Thief of Paradise; him long of old Thou didst debel, and down from Heav'n cast With all his Army, now thou hast aveng'd Supplanted Adam, and by vanquishing Temptation, hast regain'd lost Paradise, And frustrated the conquest fraudulent: He never more henceforth will dare set foot In Paradise to tempt; his snares are broke: For though that seat of earthly bliss be fail'd, A fairer Paradise is founded now For Adam and his chosen Sons, whom thou A Saviour art come down to re-install. Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be Of Tempter and Temptation without fear. But thou, Infernal Serpent, shalt not long Rule in the Clouds; like an Autumnal Star Or Lightning thou shalt fall from Heav'n trod down Under his feet: for proof, e're this thou feel'st Thy wound, yet not thy last and deadliest wound By this repulse receiv'd, and hold'st in Hell No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues Thy bold attempt; hereafter learn with awe To dread the Son of God: he all unarm'd Shall chase thee with the terror of his voice From thy Demoniac holds, possession foul, Thee and thy Legions, yelling they shall flye, And beg to hide them in a herd of Swine, Lest he command them down into the deep Bound, and to torment sent before thir time. Hail Son of the most High, heir of both worlds, Queller of Satan, on thy glorious work Now enter, and begin to save mankind.    Thus they the Son of God our Saviour meek Sung Victor, and from Heavenly Feast refresht Brought on his way with joy; hee unobserv'd Home to his Mothers house private return'd."

        "I Dug, Beneath the Cypress Shade": "I dug, beneath the cypress shade,    What well might seem an elfin's grave;And every pledge in earth I laid,    That erst thy false affection gave.I pressed them down the sod beneath;    I placed one mossy stone above;And twined the rose's fading wreath    Around the sepulchre of love.Frail as thy love, the flowers were dead,    Ere yet the evening sun was set:But years shall see the cypress spread,    Immutable as my regret.",

        "Maria's Return": "The whit'ning ground           In frost is bound;    The snow is swiftly falling; While coldly blows the northern breeze, And whistles through the leafless trees,    In hollow sounds appalling.             On this cold plain,           Now reach'd with pain,    Once stood my father's dwelling: Where smiling pleasure once was found, Now desolation frowns around,    And wintry blasts are yelling.             Hope's visions wild           My thoughts beguil'd,    My earliest days delighting, Till unsuspected treach'ry came, Beneath affection's specious name,    The lovely prospect blighting.             With many a wile           Of blackest guile    Did Henry first deceive me: What winning words to him were giv'n! He swore, by all the pow'rs of Heav'n,    That he would never leave me.             With fondest truth           I lov'd the youth:    My soul, to guilt a stranger, Knew not, in those too simple hours, That oft beneath the sweetest flow'rs    Is couch'd the deadliest danger.             With him to roam           I fled my home;    I burst the bonds of duty; I thought my days in joy would roll; But Henry hid a demon's soul    Beneath an angel's beauty!             Shall this poor heart           E'er cease to smart?    Oh never! never! never! Did av'rice whisper thee, or pride, False Henry! for a wealthier bride    To cast me off for ever?             My sire was poor:           No golden store    Had he, no earthly treasure: I only could his griefs assuage, The only pillar of his age,    His only source of pleasure.             With anguish wild,           He miss'd his child,    And long in vain he sought her: The fiercest thunder-bolts of heav'n Shall on thy guilty head be driv'n,    Thou Disobedient Daughter!             I feel his fears,           I see his tears,    I hear his groans of sadness: My cruel falsehood seal'd his doom: He seems to curse me from the tomb,    And fire my brain to madness!             Oh! keenly blow,           While drifts the snow,    The cold nocturnal breezes; On me the gath'ring snow-flakes rest, And colder grows my friendless breast;    My very heart-blood freezes!             'Tis midnight deep,           And thousands sleep,    Unknown to guilt and sorrow; They think not of a wretch like me, Who cannot, dare not, hope to see    The rising light to-morrow!             An outcast hurl'd           From all the world,    Whom none would love or cherish, What now remains to end my woes, But here, amid the deep'ning snows,    To lay me down and perish?

Thus rolls the day,\n The short dark day of life;   with tempests thus,\n And fleeting sun-shine chequer'd.   At its close,\n When the dread hour draws near, that bursts all ties,\n All commerce with the world, Religion pours\n Hope's fairy-colors on the virtuous mind,\n And, like the rain-bow on the ev'ning clouds,\n Gives the bright promise that a happier dawn\n Shall chase the night and silence of the grave.",

Fate has doom'd us to part, But the prospect occasions no pang to my heart; No longer is love with my reason at strife, Though once thou wert dearer, far dearer than life.   As together we roam'd, I the passion confess'd, Which thy beauty and virtue had rais'd in my breast; That the passion was mutual thou mad'st me believe, And I thought my Matilda could never deceive.   My Matilda! no, false one! my claims I resign: Thou canst not, thou must not, thou shalt not be mine: I now scorn thee as much as I lov'd thee before, Nor sigh when I think I shall meet thee no more.   Though fair be thy form, thou no lovers wilt find, While folly and falsehood inhabit thy mind, Though coxcombs may flatter, though ideots may prize, Thou art shunn'd by the good, and contemn'd by the wise.   Than mine what affection more fervent could be, When I thought ev'ry virtue was center'd in thee? Of the vows thou hast broken I will not complain, For I mourn not the loss of a heart I disdain.   Oh! hadst thou but constant and amiable prov'd As that fancied perfection I formerly lov'd, Nor absence, nor time, though supreme their controul, Could have dimm'd the dear image then stamp'd on my soul.   How bright were the pictures, untinted with shade, By Hope's glowing pencil on Fancy pourtray'd! Sweet visions of bliss! which I could not retain; For they, like thyself, were deceitful and vain.   Some other, perhaps, to Matilda is dear, Some other, more pleasing, though not more sincere; May he fix thy light passions, now wav'ring as air, Then leave thee, inconstant, to shame and despair!   Repent not, Matilda, return not to me: Unavailing thy grief, thy repentance will be: In vain will thy vows or thy smiles be resum'd, For love, once extinguish'd, is never relum'd.",

        "Champagne, 1914-15": "In the glad revels, in the happy fetes,    When cheeks are flushed, and glasses gilt and pearled With the sweet wine of France that concentrates    The sunshine and the beauty of the world,   Drink sometimes, you whose footsteps yet may tread    The undisturbed, delightful paths of Earth, To those whose blood, in pious duty shed,    Hallows the soil where that same wine had birth.   Here, by devoted comrades laid away,    Along our lines they slumber where they fell, Beside the crater at the Ferme d'Alger    And up the bloody slopes of La Pompelle,   And round the city whose cathedral towers    The enemies of Beauty dared profane, And in the mat of multicolored flowers    That clothe the sunny chalk-fields of Champagne.   Under the little crosses where they rise    The soldier rests. Now round him undismayed The cannon thunders, and at night he lies    At peace beneath the eternal fusillade ...   That other generations might possess--    From shame and menace free in years to come-- A richer heritage of happiness,    He marched to that heroic martyrdom.   Esteeming less the forfeit that he paid    Than undishonored that his flag might float Over the towers of liberty, he made    His breast the bulwark and his blood the moat.   Obscurely sacrificed, his nameless tomb,    Bare of the sculptor's art, the poet's lines, Summer shall flush with poppy-fields in bloom,    And Autumn yellow with maturing vines.   There the grape-pickers at their harvesting    Shall lightly tread and load their wicker trays, Blessing his memory as they toil and sing    In the slant sunshine of October days ...   I love to think that if my blood should be    So privileged to sink where his has sunk, I shall not pass from Earth entirely,    But when the banquet rings, when healths are drunk,   And faces that the joys of living fill    Glow radiant with laughter and good cheer, In beaming cups some spark of me shall still    Brim toward the lips that once I held so dear.   So shall one coveting no higher plane    Than nature clothes in color and flesh and tone, Even from the grave put upward to attain    The dreams youth cherished and missed and might have known;   And that strong need that strove unsatisfied    Toward earthly beauty in all forms it wore, Not death itself shall utterly divide    From the beloved shapes it thirsted for.   Alas, how many an adept for whose arms    Life held delicious offerings perished here, How many in the prime of all that charms,    Crowned with all gifts that conquer and endear!   Honor them not so much with tears and flowers,    But you with whom the sweet fulfilment lies, Where in the anguish of atrocious hours    Turned their last thoughts and closed their dying eyes,   Rather when music on bright gatherings lays    Its tender spell, and joy is uppermost, Be mindful of the men they were, and raise    Your glasses to them in one silent toast.   Drink to them--amorous of dear Earth as well,    They asked no tribute lovelier than this-- And in the wine that ripened where they fell,    Oh, frame your lips as though it were a kiss.",

Renouncing both, a flake in the ferment Of battling hosts that conquer or recoil, There only, chastened by fatigue and toil, I knew what came the nearest to content. For there at least my troubled flesh was free From the gadfly Desire that plagued it so; Discord and Strife were what I used to know, Heartaches, deception, murderous jealousy; By War transported far from all of these, Amid the clash of arms I was at peace.",

But thou shrieking harbinger, Foul precurrer of the fiend, Augur of the fever's end, To this troop come thou not near.  From this session interdict Every fowl of tyrant wing, Save the eagle, feather'd king; Keep the obsequy so strict.  Let the priest in surplice white, That defunctive music can, Be the death-divining swan, Lest the requiem lack his right.

Here the anthem doth commence: Love and constancy is dead; Phoenix and the Turtle fled In a mutual flame from hence.  So they lov'd, as love in twain Had the essence but in one; Two distincts, division none: Number there in love was slain.  Hearts remote, yet not asunder; Distance and no space was seen 'Twixt this Turtle and his queen: But in them it were a wonder.  So between them love did shine That the Turtle saw his right Flaming in the Phoenix' sight: Either was the other's mine.  Property was thus appalled That the self was not the same; Single nature's double name Neither two nor one was called.  Reason, in itself confounded, Saw division grow together, To themselves yet either neither, Simple were so well compounded;  That it cried, \"How true a twain Seemeth this concordant one! Love has reason, reason none, If what parts can so remain.\"  Whereupon it made this threne To the Phoenix and the Dove, Co-supremes and stars of love, As chorus to their tragic scene:                   threnosBeauty, truth, and rarity, Grace in all simplicity, Here enclos'd, in cinders lie.  Death is now the Phoenix' nest, And the Turtle's loyal breast To eternity doth rest,  Leaving no posterity: 'Twas not their infirmity, It was married chastity.

        "Sonnet 139: O, call not me to justify the wrong": "O, call not me to justify the wrongThat thy unkindness lays upon my heart;Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;Use power with power, and slay me not by art.Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight, Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside;What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy mightIs more than my o'erpressed defense can bide?Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knowsHer pretty looks have been mine enemies;And therefore from my face she turns my foes,That they elsewhere might dart their injuries--    Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,    Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.",
        "Sonnet 142: Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate": "Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,That have profaned their scarlet ornamentsAnd sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine, Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st thoseWhom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows, Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.     If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,    By self-example mayst thou be denied.",
        "Sonnet 147: My love is as a fever, longing still": "My love is as a fever, longing stillFor that which longer nurseth the disease,Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,Th' uncertain sickly appetite to please.My reason, the physician to my love,Angry that his prescriptions are not kept, Hath left me, and I desperate now approveDesire is death, which physic did except.Past cure I am, now reason is past care, And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,At random from the truth vainly expressed:    For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.",
        "Venus and Adonis": "Even as the sun with purple-colour'd face      Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn,      Rose-cheek'd Adonis tried him to the chase;      Hunting he lov'd, but love he laugh'd to scorn;              Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,        And like a bold-fac'd suitor 'gins to woo him.        'Thrice fairer than myself,' thus she began,      'The field's chief flower, sweet above compare,              Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,      More white and red than doves or roses are;        Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,        Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.             'Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,      And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;      If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed      A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know:          Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses;      And being set, I'll smother thee with kisses:        'And yet not cloy thy lips with loath'd satiety,      But rather famish them amid their plenty,          Making them red and pale with fresh variety;      Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty:        A summer's day will seem an hour but short,        Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.'                 With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,      The precedent of pith and livelihood,      And, trembling in her passion, calls it balm,      Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:        Being so enrag'd, desire doth lend her force        Courageously to pluck him from his horse.        Over one arm the lusty courser's rein      Under her other was the tender boy,       Who blush'd and pouted in a dull disdain,      With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;        She red and hot as coals of glowing fire        He red for shame, but frosty in desire.         The studded bridle on a ragged bough      Nimbly she fastens;--O! how quick is love:--      The steed is stalled up, and even now      To tie the rider she begins to prove:          Backward she push'd him, as she would be thrust,        And govern'd him in strength, though not in lust.        So soon was she along, as he was down,      Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:       Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,      And 'gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips;      And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,      'If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.'              He burns with bashful shame; she with her tears      Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;      Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs      To fan and blow them dry again she seeks:          He saith she is immodest, blames her miss;        What follows more she murders with a kiss.        Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,      Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,            Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,      Till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone;      Even so she kiss'd his brow, his cheek, his chin,      And where she ends she doth anew begin.              Forc'd to content, but never to obey,      Panting he lies, and breatheth in her face;      She feedeth on the steam, as on a prey,      And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace;                 Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers        So they were dewd with such distilling showers.        Look! how a bird lies tangled in a net,      So fasten'd in her arms Adonis lies;               Pure shame and aw'd resistance made him fret,      Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes:        Rain added to a river that is rank        Perforce will force it overflow the bank.            Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,      For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale;      Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets,      'Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale;            Being red she loves him best; and being white,        Her best is better'd with a more delight.        Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;      And by her fair immortal hand she swears,          From his soft bosom never to remove,      Till he take truce with her contending tears,        Which long have rain'd, making her cheeks all wet;        And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.        Upon this promise did he raise his chin            Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,      Who, being look'd on, ducks as quickly in;      So offers he to give what she did crave;             But when her lips were ready for his pay,        He winks, and turns his lips another way.        Never did passenger in summer's heat      More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.          Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;      She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn:        'O! pity,' 'gan she cry, 'flint-hearted boy:        'Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy?           'I have been woo'd, as I entreat thee now,      Even by the stern and direful god of war,      Whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow,      Who conquers where he comes in every jar;            Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,        And begg'd for that which thou unask'd shalt have.        'Over my altars hath he hung his lance,      His batter'd shield, his uncontrolled crest,               And for my sake hath learn'd to sport and dance      To toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest;        Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red        Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.                 'Thus he that overrul'd I oversway'd,      Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain:      Strong-temper'd steel his stronger strength obey'd,      Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.               O! be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,        For mastering her that foil'd the god of fight.        Touch but my lips with those falr lips of thine,--      Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red,--            The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine:      What seest thou in the ground? hold up thy head:        Look in mine eyeballs, there thy beauty lies;        Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?             'Art thou asham'd to kiss? then wink again,      And I will wink; so shall the day seem night;      Love keeps his revels where there are but twain;      Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight:         These blue-vein'd violets whereon we lean        Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.        'The tender spring upon thy tempting lip          Shows thee unripe, yet mayst thou well be tasted:      Make use of time, let not advantage slip;      Beauty within itself should not be wasted:        Fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime        Rot and consume themselves in little time.                 'Were I hard-favour'd, foul, or wrinkled-old,      Ill-nurtur'd, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,      O'erworn, despised, rheumatic, and cold,      Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice,              Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee;        But having no defects, why dost abhor me?        'Thou canst not see one winkle in my brow;        Mine eyes are grey and bright, and quick in turning;      My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow;      My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning;        My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt.        Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.               'Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,      Or like a fairy, trip upon the green,      Or, like a nymph, with long dishevell'd hair,      Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:                 Love is a spirit all compact of fire,        Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.        'Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie;        These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;      Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,      From morn till night, even where I list to sport me:        Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be        That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?               'Is thine own heart to shine own face affected?      Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?      Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,      Steal thine own freedom, and complain on theft.              Narcissus so himself himself forsook,        And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.        'Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,      Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,               Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear;      Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse:        Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth beauty;        Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.           'Upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed,      Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?      By law of nature thou art bound to breed,      That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;              And so in spite of death thou dost survive,        In that thy likeness still is left alive.'        By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,      For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,            And Titan, tired in the mid-day heat      With burning eye did hotly overlook them,        Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,        So he were like him and by Venus' side.           And now Adonis with a lazy spright,      And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,      His louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight,      Like misty vapours when they blot the sky,          Souring his cheeks, cries, 'Fie! no more of love:        The sun doth burn my face; I must remove.'        'Ay me,' quoth Venus, 'young, and so unkind!      What bare excuses mak'st thou to be gone!         I'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind      Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:        I'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;          If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears.        'The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,      And lo! I lie between that sun and thee:      The heat I have from thence doth little harm,      Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me;              And were I not immortal, life were done        Between this heavenly and earthly sun.        'Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel?      Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth:         Art thou a woman's son, and canst not feel      What 'tis to love? how want of love tormenteth?        O! had thy mother borne so hard a mind,           She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.          'What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this?      Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?      What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?        Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:        Give me one kiss, I'll give it thee again,               And one for interest if thou wilt have twain.        'Fie! lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,      Well-painted idol, image dull and dead,           Statue contenting but the eye alone,      Thing like a man, but of no woman bred:        Thou art no man, though of a man's complexion,        For men will kiss even by their own direction.'            This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,      And swelling passion doth provoke a pause;      Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong;      Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause:             And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,        And now her sobs do her intendments break.        Sometimes she shakes her head, and then his hand;      Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;         Sometimes her arms infold him like a band:      She would, he will not in her arms be bound;        And when from thence he struggles to be gone,        She locks her lily fingers one in one.            'Fondling,' she saith, 'since I have hemm'd thee here      Within the circuit of this ivory pale,      I'll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;      Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:                Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry,        Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.        'Within this limit is relief enough,      Sweet bottom-grass and high delightful plain,              Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,      To shelter thee from tempest and from rain:        Then be my deer, since I am such a park;          No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.'        At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,      That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple:      Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,      He might be buried in a tomb so simple;             Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,        Why, there Love liv'd, and there he could not die.        These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,      Open'd their mouths to swallow Venus' liking.              Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?      Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?        Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,        To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!              Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?      Her words are done, her woes the more increasing;      The time is spent, her object will away,      And from her twining arms doth urge releasing:               'Pity,' she cries; 'some favour, some remorse!'        Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse.        But lo! from forth a copse that neighbours by,      A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,       Adonis' tramping courier doth espy,      And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:        The strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,        Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.            Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,      And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;      The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,      Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;        The iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth,                 Controlling what he was controlled with.        His ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane      Upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;        His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,      As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:        His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,        Shows his hot courage and his high desire.                 Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,      With gentle majesty and modest pride;      Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,      As who should say, 'Lo! thus my strength is tried;        And this I do to captivate the eye                Of the fair breeder that is standing by.'        What recketh he his rider's angry stir,      His flattering 'Holla', or his 'Stand, I say'?             What cares he now for curb or pricking spur?      For rich caparisons or trapping gay?        He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,        Nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees.              Look, when a painter would surpass the life,      In limning out a well-proportion'd steed,      His art with nature's workmanship at strife,      As if the dead the living should exceed;            So did this horse excel a common one,        In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.        Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,      Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,      High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,      Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:        Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,        Save a proud rider on so proud a back.            Sometimes he scuds far off, and there he stares;      Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;      To bid the wind a base he now prepares,      And whe'r he run or fly they know not whether;               For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,        Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.        He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;      She answers him as if she knew his mind;          Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,      She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,        Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,        Beating his kind embracements with her heels.              Then, like a melancholy malcontent,      He vails his tail, that, like a falling plume,      Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:      He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume.             His love, perceiving how he is enrag'd,        Grew kinder, and his fury was assuag'd.        His testy master goeth about to take him;      When lo! the unback'd breeder, full of fear,               Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,      With her the horse, and left Adonis there:        As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,        Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them.            All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,      Banning his boisterous and unruly beast:      And now the happy season once more fits,      That love-sick Love by pleading may be blest;                For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong        When it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue.        An oven that is stopp'd, or river stay'd,      Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage:               So of concealed sorrow may be said;      Free vent of words love's fire doth assuage;        But when the heart's attorney once is mute        The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.               He sees her coming, and begins to glow,--      Even as a dying coal revives with wind,--      And with his bonnet hides his angry brow;      Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,                 Taking no notice that she is so nigh,        For all askance he holds her in his eye.        O! what a sight it was, wistly to view      How she came stealing to the wayward boy;         To note the fighting conflict of her hue,      How white and red each other did destroy:        But now her cheek was pale, and by and by        It flash'd forth fire, as lightning from the sky.          Now was she just before him as he sat,      And like a lowly lover down she kneels;      With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,      Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:         His tenderer cheek receives her soft hand's print,        As apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint.        O! what a war of looks was then between them;      Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing;           His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them;      Her eyes woo'd still, his eyes disdain'd the wooing:        And all this dumb play had his acts made plain        With tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain.        Full gently now she takes him by the hand,        A lily prison'd in a gaol of snow,      Or ivory in an alabaster band;      So white a friend engirts so white a foe:           This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,        Show'd like two silver doves that sit a-billing.        Once more the engine of her thoughts began:      'O fairest mover on this mortal round,            Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,      My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound;        For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,        Though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee.'        'Give me my hand,' saith he, 'why dost thou feel it?'      'Give me my heart,' saith she, 'and thou shalt have it;      O! give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,      And being steel'd, soft sighs can never grave it:            Then love's deep groans I never shall regard,        Because Adonis' heart hath made mine hard.'        'For shame,' he cries, 'let go, and let me go;      My day's delight is past, my horse is gone,       And 'tis your fault I am bereft him so:      I pray you hence, and leave me here alone:        For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,        Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.'          Thus she replies: 'Thy palfrey, as he should,      Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire:      Affection is a coal that must be cool'd;      Else, suffer'd, it will set the heart on fire:               The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;        Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.        'How like a Jade he stood, tied to the tree,      Servilely master'd with a leathern rein!          But when he saw his love, his youth's fair fee,      He held such petty bondage in disdain;        Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,        Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.             'Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,      Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,      But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed,      His other agents aim at like delight?               Who is so faint, that dare not be so bold        To touch the fire, the weather being cold?        'Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy;      And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,        To take advantage on presented joy      Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee.        O learn to love, the lesson is but plain,        And once made perfect, never lost again.          'I know not love,' quoth he, 'nor will not know it,      Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;      'Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;      My love to love is love but to disgrace it;         For I have heard it is a life in death,        That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.        'Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd?      Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?              If springing things be any jot diminish'd,      They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth;        The colt that's back'd and burden'd being young        Loseth his pride, and never waxeth strong.                 'You hurt my hand with wringing. Let us part,      And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:      Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;      To love's alarms it will not ope the gate:          Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery;        For where a heart is hard they make no battery.'        'What! canst thou talk?' quoth she, 'hast thou a tongue?      O! would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing;              Thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong;      I had my load before, now press'd with bearing:        Melodious discord, heavenly tune, harsh-sounding,        Ear's deep-sweet music, and heart's deep-sore wounding.        'Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love       That inward beauty and invisible;      Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move      Each part in me that were but sensible:             Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,        Yet should I be in love by touching thee.        'Say, that the sense of feeling were bereft me,      And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch,             And nothing but the very smell were left me,      Yet would my love to thee be still as much;        For from the stillitory of thy face excelling        Comes breath perfum'd that breedeth love by smelling.        'But O! what banquet wert thou to the taste,               Being nurse and feeder of the other four;      Would they not wish the feast might ever last,      And bid Suspicion double-lock the door,        Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,        Should, by his stealing in, disturb the feast?'            Once more the ruby-colour'd portal open'd,      Which to his speech did honey passage yield,               Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken'd      Wrack to the seaman, tempest to the field,        Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,        Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.              This ill presage advisedly she marketh:      Even as the wind is hush'd before it raineth,      Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,      Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,          Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,        His meaning struck her ere his words begun.        And at his look she flatly falleth down      For looks kill love, and love by looks reviveth;           A smile recures the wounding of a frown;      But blessed bankrupt, that by love so thriveth!        The silly boy, believing she is dead        Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;          And all amaz'd brake off his late intent,      For sharply he did think to reprehend her,      Which cunning love did wittily prevent:      Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her!               For on the grass she lies as she were slain        Till his breath breatheth life in her again.        He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,      He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,               He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks      To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr'd:        He kisses her; and she, by her good will,        Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.                The night of sorrow now is turn'd to day:      Her two blue windows faintly she up-heaveth,      Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array      He cheers the morn, and all the world relieveth:             And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,        So is her face illumin'd with her eye;        Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd,      As if from thence they borrow'd all their shine.           Were never four such lamps together mix'd,      Had not his clouded with his brow's repine;        But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light        Shone like the moon in water seen by night.                'O! where am I?' quoth she, 'in earth or heaven,      Or in the ocean drench'd, or in the fire?      What hour is this? or morn or weary even?      Do I delight to die, or life desire?                But now I liv'd, and life was death's annoy;        But now I died, and death was lively joy.        'O! thou didst kill me; kill me once again:      Thy eyes' shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,          Hath taught them scornful tricks, and such disdain,      That they have murder'd this poor heart of mine;        And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,        But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.                 'Long may they kiss each other for this cure!      O! never let their crimson liveries wear;      And as they last, their verdure still endure,      To drive infection from the dangerous year:         That the star-gazers, having writ on death,        May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.        'Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,      What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?             To sell myself I can be well contented,      So thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing;        Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips        Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips.           'A thousand kisses buys my heart from me;      And pay them at thy leisure, one by one.      What is ten hundred touches unto thee?      Are they not quickly told and quickly gone?         Say, for non-payment that the debt should double,        Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?'        'Fair queen,' quoth he, 'if any love you owe me,      Measure my strangeness with my unripe years:               Before I know myself, seek not to know me;      No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears:        The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,        Or being early pluck'd is sour to taste.          'Look! the world's comforter, with weary gait      His day's hot task hath ended in the west;      The owl, night's herald, shrieks, 'tis very late;      The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest,             And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven's light        Do summon us to part, and bid good night.        'Now let me say good night, and so say you;      If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.'       'Good night,' quoth she; and ere he says adieu,      The honey fee of parting tender'd is:        Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;        Incorporate then they seem, face grows to face.            Till, breathless, he disjoin'd, and backward drew      The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,      Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,      Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth:                He with her plenty press'd, she faint with dearth,        Their lips together glu'd, fall to the earth.        Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,      And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;             Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,      Paying what ransom the insulter willeth;        Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,        That she will draw his lips' rich treasure dry.            And having felt the sweetness of the spoil,      With blindfold fury she begins to forage;      Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,      And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage;              Planting oblivion, beating reason back,        Forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack.        Hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing,      Like a wild bird being tam'd with too much handling,      Or as the fleet-foot roe that's tir'd with chasing,        Or like the froward infant still'd with dandling,        He now obeys, and now no more resisteth,        While she takes all she can, not all she listeth.          What wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering,      And yields at last to every light impression?      Things out of hope are compass'd oft with venturing,      Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission:             Affection faints not like a pale-fac'd coward,        But then woos best when most his choice is froward.        When he did frown, O! had she then gave over,      Such nectar from his lips she had not suck'd.              Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover;      What though the rose have prickles, yet 'tis pluck'd:        Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,        Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.        For pity now she can no more detain him;          The poor fool prays her that he may depart:      She is resolv'd no longer to restrain him,      Bids him farewell, and look well to her heart,               The which, by Cupid's bow she doth protest,        He carries thence incaged in his breast.        'Sweet boy,' she says, 'this night I'll waste in sorrow,      For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch.             Tell me, Love's master, shall we meet to-morrow      Say, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?'        He tells her, no; to-morrow he intends        To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.              'The boar!' quoth she; whereat a sudden pale,      Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,      Usurps her cheeks, she trembles at his tale,      And on his neck her yoking arms she throws:         She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,        He on her belly falls, she on her back.        Now is she in the very lists of love,      Her champion mounted for the hot encounter:       All is imaginary she doth prove,      He will not manage her, although he mount her;        That worse than Tantalus' is her annoy,        To clip Elysium and to lack her joy.              Even as poor birds, deceiv'd with painted grapes,      Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw,      Even so she languisheth in her mishaps,      As those poor birds that helpless berries saw.               The warm effects which she in him finds missing,        She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.        But all in vain, good queen, it will not be:      She hath assay'd as much as may be prov'd;        Her pleading hath deserv'd a greater fee;      She's Love, she loves, and yet she is not lov'd.        'Fie, fie!' he says, 'you crush me; let me go;        You have no reason to withhold me so.'            'Thou hadst been gone,' quoth she, 'sweet boy, ere this,      But that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar.      O! be advis'd; thou know'st not what it is      With javelin's point a churlish swine to gore,               Whose tushes never sheath'd he whetteth still,        Like to a mortal butcher, bent to kill.        'On his bow-back he hath a battle set      Of bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes;               His eyes like glow-worms shine when he doth fret;      His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;        Being mov'd, he strikes whate'er is in his way,        And whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay.               'His brawny sides, with hairy bristles arm'd,      Are better proof than thy spear's point can enter;      His short thick neck cannot be easily harm'd;      Being ireful, on the lion he will venture:          The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,        As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.        'Alas! he nought esteems that face of thine,      To which Love's eyes pay tributary gazes;         Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips, and crystal eyne,      Whose full perfection all the world amazes;        But having thee at vantage, wondrous dread!        Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.        'O! let him keep his loathsome cabin still;       Beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends:      Come not within his danger by thy will;      They that thrive well take counsel of their friends.        When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,        I fear'd thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.        'Didst thou not mark my face? was it not white?      Saw'st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye?            Grew I not faint? And fell I not downright?      Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,        My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,        But, like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.        'For where Love reigns, disturbing Jealousy       Doth call himself Affection's sentinel;      Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,      And in a peaceful hour doth cry \"Kill, kill!\"                Distempering gentle Love in his desire,        As air and water do abate the fire.        'This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,      This canker that eats up Love's tender spring,             This carry-tale, dissentious Jealousy,      That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,        Knocks at my heart, and whispers in mine ear        That if I love thee, I thy death should fear:              'And more than so, presenteth to mine eye      The picture of an angry-chafing boar,      Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie      An image like thyself, all stain'd with gore;                Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed        Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.        'What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,      That tremble at the imagination?         The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,      And fear doth teach it divination:        I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,        If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow.                 'But if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul'd by me;      Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,      Or at the fox which lives by subtilty,      Or at the roe which no encounter dare:              Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,        And on thy well-breath'd horse keep with thy hound.        'And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,      Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles            How he outruns the winds, and with what care      He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:        The many musits through the which he goes        Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.           'Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,      To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,      And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,      To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,            And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer;        Danger deviseth shifts, wit waits on fear:        'For there his smell with others being mingled,            The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,      Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled      With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;        Then do they spend their mouths: Echo replies,        As if another chase were in the skies.            'By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,      Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,      To hearken if his foes pursue him still:      Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;             And now his grief may be compared well      To one sore sick that hears the passing bell.        'Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch      Turn, and return, indenting with the way;         Each envious briar his weary legs doth scratch,      Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:        For misery is trodden on by many,        And being low never reliev'd by any.              'Lie quietly, and hear a little more;      Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:      To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,      Unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize,             Applying this to that, and so to so;        For love can comment upon every woe.        'Where did I leave?' 'No matter where,' quoth he      'Leave me, and then the story aptly ends:         The night is spent,' 'Why, what of that?' quoth she.      'I am,' quoth he, 'expected of my friends;        And now 'tis dark, and going I shall fall.'        'In night,' quoth she, 'desire sees best of all.'          But if thou fall, O! then imagine this,      The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,      And all is but to rob thee of a kiss.             Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips        Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,        Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.        'Now of this dark night I perceive the reason:      Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine       Till forging Nature be condemn'd of treason,      For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine;        Wherein she fram'd thee in high heaven's despite,        To shame the sun by day and her by night.         'And therefore hath she brib'd the Destinies,      To cross the curious workmanship of nature      To mingle beauty with infirmities,      And pure perfection with impure defeature;          Making it subject to the tyranny        Of mad mischances and much misery;        'As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,      Life-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood,               The marrow-eating sickness, whose attains      Disorder breeds by heating of the blood;        Surfeits, imposthumes, grief, and damn'd despair,        Swear nature's death for framing thee so fair.             'And not the least of all these maladies      But in one minute's fight brings beauty under:      Both favour, savour hue, and qualities,      Whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder,                 Are on the sudden wasted, thaw'd and done,        As mountain-snow melts with the mid-day sun.        'Therefore, despite of fruitless chastity,      Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns,        That on the earth would breed a scarcity      And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,        Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night        Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.              'What is thy body but a swallowing grave,      Seeming to bury that posterity      Which by the rights of time thou needs must have,      If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity?         If so, the world will hold thee in disdain,        Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.          'So in thyself thyself art made away;      A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife,              Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,      Or butcher-sire that reeves his son of life.        Foul-cankering rust the hidden treasure frets,        But gold that's put to use more gold begets.'              'Nay then,' quoth Adon, 'you will fall again      Into your idle over-handled theme;      The kiss I gave you is bestow'd in vain,      And all in vain you strive against the stream;               For by this black-fac'd night, desire's foul nurse,        Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.        'If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,      And every tongue more moving than your own,       Bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs,      Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown;        For know, my heart stands armed in mine ear,        And will not let a false sound enter there;                'Lest the deceiving harmony should run      Into the quiet closure of my breast;      And then my little heart were quite undone,      In his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest.             No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,        But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.        'What have you urg'd that I cannot reprove?      The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger;              I hate not love, but your device in love      That lends embracements unto every stranger.        You do it for increase: O strange excuse!        When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse.          'Call it not, love, for Love to heaven is fled,      Since sweating Lust on earth usurp'd his name;      Under whose simple semblance he hath fed      Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame;          Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves,        As caterpillars do the tender leaves.        'Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,      But Lust's effect is tempest after sun;           Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain,      Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done.        Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies;        Love is all truth, Lust full of forged lies.               'More I could tell, but more I dare not say;      The text is old, the orator too green.      Therefore, in sadness, now I will away;      My face is full of shame, my heart of teen:         Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended        Do burn themselves for having so offended.'        With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace               Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,      And homeward through the dark laund runs apace;      Leaves Love upon her back deeply distress'd.        Look, how a bright star shooteth from the sky        So glides he in the night from Venus' eye;                 Which after him she darts, as one on shore      Gazing upon a late-embarked friend,      Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,      Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend:                So did the merciless and pitchy night        Fold in the object that did feed her sight.        Whereat amaz'd, as one that unaware      Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,       Or 'stonish'd as night-wanderers often are,      Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood;        Even so confounded in the dark she lay,        Having lost the fair discovery of her way.                 And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,      That all the neighbour caves, as seeming troubled,      Make verbal repetition of her moans;      Passion on passion deeply is redoubled:             'Ay me!' she cries, and twenty times, 'Woe, woe!'        And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.        She marking them, begins a wailing note,      And sings extemporally a woeful ditty;            How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;      How love is wise in folly foolish-witty:        Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,        And still the choir of echoes answer so.          Her song was tedious, and outwore the night,      For lovers' hours are long, though seeming short:      If pleas'd themselves, others, they think, delight      In such like circumstance, with such like sport:             Their copious stories, oftentimes begun,        End without audience, and are never done.        For who hath she to spend the night withal,      But idle sounds resembling parasites;             Like shrill-tongu'd tapsters answering every call,      Soothing the humour of fantastic wits?        She says, ''Tis so:' they answer all, ''Tis so;'        And would say after her, if she said 'No'.                 Lo! here the gentle lark, weary of rest,      From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,      And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast      The sun ariseth in his majesty;            Who doth the world so gloriously behold,        That cedar-tops and hills seem burnish'd gold.        Venus salutes him with this fair good morrow:      'O thou clear god, and patron of all light,       From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow      The beauteous influence that makes him bright,        There lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother,        May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other'        This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,         Musing the morning is so much o'erworn,      And yet she hears no tidings of her love;      She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn:                Anon she hears them chant it lustily,        And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.        And as she runs, the bushes in the way      Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,            Some twine about her thigh to make her stay:      She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,        Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,        Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.                By this she hears the hounds are at a bay;      Whereat she starts, like one that spies an adder      Wreath'd up in fatal folds just in his way,      The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;        Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds                 Appals her senses, and her spirit confounds.        For now she knows it is no gentle chase,      But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,             Because the cry remaineth in one place,      Wilere fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud:        Finding their enemy to be so curst,        They all strain courtesy who shall cope him first.        This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,           Througll which it enters to surprise her heart;      Who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,      With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part;        Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,        They basely fly and dare not stay the field.        Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy,      Till, cheering up her senses sore dismay'd,       She tells them 'tis a causeless fantasy,      And childish error, that they are afraid;        Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more:        And with that word she spied the hunted boar;        Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red,        Like milk and blood being mingled both together,      A second fear through all her sinews spread,      Which madly hurries her she knows not whither:               This way she runs, and now she will no further,        But back retires to rate the boar for murther.        A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways,      She treads the path that she untreads again;               Her more than haste is mated with delays,      Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,        Full of respects, yet nought at all respecting,        In hand with all things, nought at all effecting.        Here kennel'd in a brake she finds a hound,       And asks the weary caitiff for his master,      And there another licking of his wound,      Gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster;             And here she meets another sadly scowling,        To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.        When he hath ceas'd his ill-resounding noise,      Another flap-mouth'd mourner, black and grim,              Against the welkin volleys out his voice;      Another and another answer him,        Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,        Shaking their scratch'd ears, bleeding as they go.        Look, how the world's poor people are amaz'd               At apparitions, signs, and prodigies,      Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gaz'd,      Infusing them with dreadful prophecies;             So she at these sad sighs draws up her breath,        And, sighing it again, exclaims on Death.        'Hard-favour'd tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,        Hateful divorce of love,'--thus chides she Death,--      'Grim-grinning ghost, earth's worm, what dost thou mean      To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,        Who when he liv'd, his breath and beauty set        Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet?           'If he be dead, O no! it cannot be,      Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it;      O yes! it may; thou hast no eyes to see,      But hatefully at random dost thou hit.              Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart        Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart.        'Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,      And, hearing him, thy power had lost his power.            The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;      They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck'st a flower.        Love's golden arrow at him shoull have fled,        And not Death's ebon dart, to strike him dead.             'Dost thou drink tears, that thou provok'st such weeping?      What may a heavy groan advantage thee?      Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping      Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?                Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigour        Since her best work is ruin'd with thy rigour.'        Here overcome, as one full of despair,      She vail'd her eyelids, who, like sluices, stopp'd         The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair      In the sweet channel of her bosom dropp'd        But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,        And with his strong course opens them again.               O! how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow;      Her eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;      Both crystals, where they view'd each other's sorrow,      Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;              But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,        Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.        Variable passions throng her constant woe,      As striving who should best become her grief;              All entertain'd, each passion labours so,      That every present sorrow seemeth chief,      But none is best; then join they all together,      Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.                By this, far off she hears some huntsman holloa;      A nurse's song no'er pleas'd her babe so well:      The dire imagination she did follow      This sound of hope doth labour to expel;            For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,        And flatters her it is Adonis' voice.        Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,      Being prison'd in her eye, like pearls in glass;           Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,      Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass        To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,        Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown'd.        O hard-believing love! how strange it seems       Not to believe, and yet too credulous;      Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;      Despair and hope make thee ridiculous:              The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,        In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.        Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought,      Adonis lives, and Death is not to blame;          It was not she that call'd him all to naught,      Now she adds honours to his hateful name;        She clepes him king of graves, and grave for kings,        Imperious supreme of all mortal things.           'No, no,' quoth she, 'sweet Death, I did but jest;      Yet pardon me, I felt a kind of fear      Whenas I met the boar, that bloody beast,      Which knows no pity, but is still severe;          Then, gentle shadow,--truth I must confess--        I rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease.        'Tis not my fault: the boar provok'd my tongue;      Be wreak'd on him, invisible commander;          'Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong;      I did but act, he 's author of my slander:        Grief hath two tongues: and never woman yet,        Could rule them both without ten women's wit.'        Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,       Her rash suspect sile doth extenuate;      And that his beauty may the better thrive,      With Death she humbly doth insinuate;              Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs; and stories        His victories, his triumphs, and his glories.        'O Jove!' quoth she, 'how much a fool was I,      To be of such a weak and silly mind              To wail his death who lives and must not die      Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind;        For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,        And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again.                'Fie, fie, fond love! thou art so full of fear      As one with treasure laden, hemm'd with thieves      Trifles, unwitnessed with eye or ear,      Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.'            Even at this word she hears a merry horn        Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn.        As falcon to the lure, away she flies;      The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light;          And in her haste unfortunately spies      The foul boar's conquest on her fair delight;        Which seen, her eyes, as murder'd with the view,        Like stars asham'd of day, themselves withdrew:        Or, as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,           Shrinks backwards in his shelly cave with pain,      And there, all smother'd up, in shade doth sit,      Long after fearing to creep forth again;           So, at his bloody view, her eyes are fled        Into the deep dark cabills of her head;        Where they resign their office and their light      To the disposing of her troubled brain;          Who bids them still consort with ugly night,      And never wound the heart with looks again;        Who, like a king perplexed in his throne,        By their suggestion gives a deadly groan,                 Whereat each tributary subject quakes;      As when the wind, imprison'd in the ground,      Struggling for passage, earth's foundation shakes,      Which with cold terror doth men's minds confound.        This mutiny each part doth so surprise           That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;        And, being open'd, threw unwilling light      Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench'd      In his soft flank; whose wonted lily white       With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench'd:        No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed        But stole his blood and seem'd with him to bleed.        This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth,          Over one shoulder doth she hang her head,      Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth;      She thinks he could not die, he is not dead:                Her voice is stopp'd, her joints forget to bow,        Her eyes are mad that they have wept till now.        Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,      That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three;      And then she reprehends her mangling eye,        That makes more gashes where no breach should be:        His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled;        For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.        'My tongue cannot express my grief for one,               And yet,' quoth she, 'behold two Adons dead!      My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,      Mine eyes are turn'd to fire, my heart to lead:             Heavy heart's lead, melt at mine eyes' red fire!        So shall I die by drops of hot desire.        'Alas! poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!      What face remains alive that's worth the viewing?      Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast      Of things long since, or anything ensuing?         The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim;        But true-sweet beauty liv'd and died with him.        'Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear!             Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:      Having no fair to lose, you need not fear;      The sun doth scorn you, and the wind doth hiss you:        But when Adonis liv'd, sun and sharp air         Lurk'd like two thieves, to rob him of his fair:        'And therefore would he put his bonnet on,      Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;       The wind would blow it off, and, being gone,      Play with his locks: then would Adonis weep;        And straight, in pity of his tender years,        They both would strive who first should dry his tears.        'To see his face the lion walk'd along           Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;      To recreate himself when he hath sung,      The tiger would be tame and gently hear him;                If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey,        And never fright the silly lamb that day.        'When he beheld his shadow in the brook,      The fishes spread on it their golden gills;               When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,      That some would sing, some other in their bills        Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries        He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.        'But this foul, grim, and urchin-spouted boar,            Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave,      Ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore;      Witness the entertainment that he gave:            If he did see his face, why then I know        He thought to kiss him, and hath killed him so.        ''Tis true, 'tis true; thus was Adonis slain:      He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,       Who did not whet his teeth at him again,      But by a kiss thought to persuade him there;        And nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine        Sheath'd unaware the tusk in his soft groin.              'Had I been tooth'd like him, I must confess,      With kissing him I should have kill'd him first;      But he is dead, and never did he bless      My youth with his; the more am I accurst.'         With this she falleth in the place she stood,        And stains her face with his congealed blood.        Sho looks upon his lips, and they are pale;      She takes him by the hand, and that is cold;              She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,      As if they heard the woeful words she told;      She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,      Where, lo! two lamps, burnt out, in darkness lies;        Two glasses where herself herself beheld         A thousand times, and now no more reflect;      Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell'd,      And every beauty robb'd of his effect:             'Wonder of time,' quoth she, 'this is my spite,        That, you being dead, the day should yet be light.        'Since thou art dead, lo! here I prophesy,      Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend:           It shall be waited on with jealousy,      Find sweet beginning, but unsavoury end;        Ne'er settled equally, but high or low;        That all love's pleasure shall not match his woe.        'It shall be fickle, false, and full of fraud,            Bud and be blasted in a breathing-while;      The bottom poison, and the top o'erstraw'd      With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile:            The strongest body shall it make most weak,        Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak.        'It shall be sparing and too full of riot,      Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;              The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,      Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;        It shall be raging mad, and silly mild,        Make the young old, the old become a child.               'It shall suspect where is no cause of fear;      It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;      It shall be merciful, and too severe,      And most deceiving when it seems most just;                 Perverse it shall be, where it shows most toward,        Put fear to velour, courage to the coward.        'It shall be cause of war and dire events,      And set dissension 'twixt the son and sire;               Subject and servile to all discontents,      As dry combustious matter is to fire:        Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy,        They that love best their love shall not enjoy.'          By this, the boy that by her side lay kill'd      Was melted like a vapour from her sight,      And in his blood that on the ground lay spill'd,      A purple flower sprung up, chequer'd with white;            Resembling well his pale cheeks, and the blood        Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.        She bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,      Comparing it to her Adonis' breath;              And says within her bosom it shall dwell,      Since he himself is reft from her by death:        She drops the stalk, and in the breach appears        Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.        'Poor flower,' quoth she, 'this was thy father's guise,      Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire,      For every little grief to wet his eyes:      To grow unto himself was his desire,               And so 'tis shine; but know, it is as good        To wither in my breast as in his blood.        'Here was thy father's bed, here in my breast;      Thou art the next of blood, and 'tis thy right:           Lo! in this hollow cradle take thy rest,      My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night:        There shall not be one minute in an hour        Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love's flower.'        Thus weary of the world, away she hies,          And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid      Their mistress, mounted, through the empty skies      In her light chariot quickly is convey'd;          Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen        Means to immure herself and not be seen.",
        "Speech: \"Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back\"": "(from Troilus and Cressida, spoken by Ulysses)\n\n\n\nTime hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'dAs fast as they are made, forgot as soon As done: perseverance, dear my lord,Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hangQuite out of fashion, like a rusty mailIn monumental mockery. Take the instant way;For honour travels in a strait so narrow,Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;For emulation hath a thousand sonsThat one by one pursue: if you give way,Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush byAnd leave you hindmost;Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours; For time is like a fashionable hostThat slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seekRemuneration for the thing it was;For beauty, wit,High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all To envious and calumniating time.One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,Though they are made and moulded of things past,And give to dust that is a little gilt More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.The present eye praises the present object.Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;Since things in motion sooner catch the eye Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,And still it might, and yet it may again,If thou wouldst not entomb thyself aliveAnd case thy reputation in thy tent;Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late, Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselvesAnd drave great Mars to faction.",
        "Speech: \"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow\"": "(from Macbeth, spoken by Macbeth)\n\n\n\nTomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,To the last syllable of recorded time;And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,And then is heard no more. It is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.",
        "Speech: \"To be, or not to be, that is the question\"": "(from Hamlet, spoken by Hamlet)\n\n\n\nTo be, or not to be, that is the question:\n Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\n The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\n Or to take arms against a sea of troubles\n And by opposing end them. To die--to sleep,\n No more; and by a sleep to say we end\n The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks\n That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation\n Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;\n To sleep, perchance to dream--ay, there's the rub:\n For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\n When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\n Must give us pause--there's the respect\n That makes calamity of so long life.\n For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\n Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\n The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,\n The insolence of office, and the spurns\n That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,\n When he himself might his quietus make\n With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,\n To grunt and sweat under a weary life,\n But that the dread of something after death,\n The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn\n No traveller returns, puzzles the will,\n And makes us rather bear those ills we have\n Than fly to others that we know not of?\n Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all,\n And thus the native hue of resolution\n Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,\n And enterprises of great pith and moment\n With this regard their currents turn awry\n And lose the name of action.",
        "Speech: \"All the world's a stage\"": "(from As You Like It, spoken by Jaques)\n\n\n\n                                        All the world's a stage,And all the men and women merely players;They have their exits and their entrances;And one man in his time plays many parts,His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;And then the whining school-boy, with his satchelAnd shining morning face, creeping like snailUnwillingly to school. And then the lover,Sighing like furnace, with a woeful balladMade to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,Seeking the bubble reputationEven in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,Full of wise saws and modern instances;And so he plays his part. The sixth age shiftsInto the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wideFor his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,Turning again toward childish treble, pipesAnd whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,That ends this strange eventful history,Is second childishness and mere oblivion;Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.",

Holy, fair, and wise is she;     The heaven such grace did lend her, That she might admired be.  Is she kind as she is fair?     For beauty lives with kindness. Love doth to her eyes repair,     To help him of his blindness; And, being helped, inhabits there.

        "Sonnet 106: When in the chronicle of wasted time": "When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of the fairest wights, And beauty making beautiful old rhyme In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights, Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best, Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, I see their antique pen would have express'd Even such a beauty as you master now. So all their praises are but prophecies Of this our time, all you prefiguring; And, for they look'd but with divining eyes, They had not skill enough your worth to sing: For we, which now behold these present days, Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.",
        "Sonnet 107: Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul": "Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul Of the wide world dreaming on things to come, Can yet the lease of my true love control, Suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd doom. The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd And the sad augurs mock their own presage; Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd And peace proclaims olives of endless age. Now with the drops of this most balmy time My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes, Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme, While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes; And thou in this shalt find thy monument, When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.",
        "Sonnet 110: Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there": "Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there And made myself a motley to the view, Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear, Made old offences of affections new. Most true it is that I have look'd on truth Askance and strangely: but, by all above, These blenches gave my heart another youth, And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love. Now all is done, have what shall have no end! Mine appetite, I never more will grind On newer proof, to try an older friend, A god in love, to whom I am confin'd. Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best, Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.",
        "Sonnet 111: O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,": "O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide, The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds, That did not better for my life provide Than public means which public manners breeds. Thence comes it that my name receives a brand, And almost thence my nature is subdu'd To what it works in, like the dyer's hand. Pity me then and wish I were renew'd; Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection; No bitterness that I will bitter think, Nor double penance, to correct correction. Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye Even that your pity is enough to cure me.",
        "Sonnet 116: Let me not to the marriage of true minds": "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove. O no! it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wand'ring bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come; Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me prov'd, I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.",
        "Sonnet 129: Th'expense of spirit in a waste of shame": "Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action; and till action, lust Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody, full of blame, Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust, Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight, Past reason hunted; and, no sooner had Past reason hated as a swallowed bait On purpose laid to make the taker mad; Mad in pursuit and in possession so, Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme; A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe; Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.     All this the world well knows; yet none knows well     To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.",
        "Sonnet 130: My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun": "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red; If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damasked, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks; And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. I love to hear her speak, yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound; I grant I never saw a goddess go; My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.    And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare    As any she belied with false compare.",
        "Sonnet 146: Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,": "Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth, [......] these rebel powers that thee array, Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth, Painting thy outward walls so costly gay? Why so large cost, having so short a lease, Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend? Shall worms, inheritors of this excess, Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end? Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss And let that pine to aggravate thy store; Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross; Within be fed, without be rich no more. So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men, And, Death once dead, there's no more dying then.",

O stay and hear, your true love's coming,       That can sing both high and low. Trip no further pretty sweeting. Journeys end in lovers' meeting,       Every wise man's son doth know.  What is love, 'tis not hereafter, Present mirth, hath present laughter:       What's to come, is still unsure. In delay there lies no plenty, Then come kiss me sweet and twenty:       Youth's a stuff will not endure.",
        "Song: \"Orpheus with his lute made trees\"": "(from Henry VIII)\n\n\n\nOrpheus with his lute made trees, And the mountain tops that freeze, Bow themselves when he did sing:To his music plants and flowers Ever sprung; as sun and showers There had made a lasting spring. Every thing that heard him play, Even the billows of the sea, Hung their heads, and then lay by. In sweet music is such art, Killing care and grief of heart Fall asleep, or hearing, die.",

Unneth I kest myne eyes Towarde the cloudy skyes: But whan I dyd beholde My sparow dead and colde, No creatuer but that wolde Have rewed upon me, To behold and se What hevynesse dyd me pange; Wherewith my handes I wrange, That my senaws cracked, As though I had ben racked, So payned and so strayned, That no lyfe wellnye remayned.  I syghed and I sobbed, For that I was robbed Of my sparowes lyfe. O mayden, wydow, and wyfe, Of what estate ye be, Of hye or lowe degre, Great sorowe than ye myght se, And lerne to wepe at me!

        "Barbury Camp": "We burrowed night and day with tools of lead,Heaped the bank up and cast it in a ringAnd hurled the earth above. And Caesar said,\"Why, it is excellent. I like the thing.\"We, who are dead,Made it, and wrought, and Caesar liked the thing.And here we strove, and here we felt each veinIce-bound, each limb fast-frozen, all night long.And here we held communion with the rainThat lashed us into manhood with its thong,Cleansing through pain.And the wind visited us and made us strong.Up from around us, numbers without name,Strong men and naked, vast, on either handPressing us in, they came. And the wind cameAnd bitter rain, turning grey all the land.That was our game,To fight with men and storms, and it was grand.For many days we fought them, and our sweatWatered the grass, making it spring up green,Blooming for us. And, if the wind was wet,Our blood wetted the wind, making it keenWith the hatredAnd wrath and courage that our blood had been.So, fighting men and winds and tempests, hotWith joy and hate and battle-lust, we fellWhere we fought. And God said, \"Killed at last then? What!Ye that are too strong for heaven, too clean for hell,(God said) stir not.This be your heaven, or, if ye will, your hell.\"So again we fight and wrestle, and againHurl the earth up and cast it in a ring.But when the wind comes up, driving the rain(Each rain-drop a fiery steed), and the mists rollingUp from the plain,This wild procession, this impetuous thing.Hold us amazed. We mount the wind-cars, thenWhip up the steeds and drive through all the world,Searching to find somewhere some brethren,Sons of the winds and waters of the world.We, who were men,Have sought, and found no men in all this world.Wind, that has blown here always ceaselessly,Bringing, if any man can understand,Might to the mighty, freedom to the free;Wind, that has caught us, cleansed us, made us grand,Wind that is we(We that were men) -- make men in all this land,That so may live and wrestle and hate that whenThey fall at last exultant, as we fell,And come to God, God may say, \"Do you come thenMildly enquiring, is it heaven or hell?Why!

And the blind fight the blind.When it is peace, then we may view againWith new-won eyes each other's truer formAnd wonder.

Little live, great pass. Jesus Christ and Barabbas Were found the same day. This died, that went his way. So sing with joyful breath, For why, you are going to death. Teeming earth will surely store All the gladness that you pour.   Earth that never doubts nor fears, Earth that knows of death, not tears, Earth that bore with joyful ease Hemlock for Socrates, Earth that blossomed and was glad 'Neath the cross that Christ had, Shall rejoice and blossom too When the bullet reaches you. Wherefore, men marching On the road to death, sing! Pour your gladness on earth's head, So be merry, so be dead.   From the hills and valleys earth Shouts back the sound of mirth, Tramp of feet and lilt of song Ringing all the road along. All the music of their going, Ringing swinging glad song-throwing, Earth will echo still, when foot Lies numb and voice mute. On, marching men, on To the gates of death with song. Sow your gladness for earth's reaping, So you may be glad, though sleeping. Strew your gladness on earth's bed, So be merry, so be dead.",
        "Such, Such is Death": "Such, such is Death: no triumph: no defeat:Only an empty pail, a slate rubbed clean,A merciful putting away of what has been.And this we know: Death is not Life, effete,Life crushed, the broken pail. We who have seenSo marvellous things know well the end not yet.Victor and vanquished are a-one in death:Coward and brave: friend, foe. Ghosts do not say,\"Come, what was your record when you drew breath?\"But a big blot has hid each yesterdaySo poor, so manifestly incomplete.And your bright Promise, withered long and sped,Is touched, stirs, rises, opens and grows sweetAnd blossoms and is you, when you are dead."

        "The Battle of Blenheim": "It was a summer evening,    Old Kaspar's work was done,And he before his cottage door    Was sitting in the sun,And by him sported on the green    His little grandchild Wilhelmine.She saw her brother Peterkin    Roll something large and round,Which he beside the rivulet    In playing there had found;He came to ask what he had found,    That was so large, and smooth, and round.Old Kaspar took it from the boy,    Who stood expectant by;And then the old man shook his head,    And, with a natural sigh,\"'Tis some poor fellow's skull,\" said he,    \"Who fell in the great victory.\"I find them in the garden,    For there's many here about;And often when I go to plough,    The ploughshare turns them out!For many thousand men,\" said he,    \"Were slain in that great victory.\"\"Now tell us what 'twas all about,\"    Young Peterkin, he cries;And little Wilhelmine looks up    With wonder-waiting eyes;\"Now tell us all about the war,    And what they fought each other for.\"\"It was the English,\" Kaspar cried,    \"Who put the French to rout;But what they fought each other for,    I could not well make out;But everybody said,\" quoth he,    \"That 'twas a famous victory.\"My father lived at Blenheim then,    Yon little stream hard by;They burnt his dwelling to the ground,    And he was forced to fly;So with his wife and child he fled,    Nor had he where to rest his head.\"With fire and sword the country round    Was wasted far and wide,And many a childing mother then,    And new-born baby died;But things like that, you know, must be    At every famous victory.\"They say it was a shocking sight    After the field was won;For many thousand bodies here    Lay rotting in the sun;But things like that, you know, must be    After a famous victory.\"Great praise the Duke of Marlbro' won,    And our good Prince Eugene.\"\"Why, 'twas a very wicked thing!\"    Said little Wilhelmine.\"Nay... nay... my little girl,\" quoth he,    \"It was a famous victory.\"And everybody praised the Duke    Who this great fight did win.\"\"But what good came of it at last?\"    Quoth little Peterkin.\"Why that I cannot tell,\" said he,    \"But 'twas a famous victory.\"",
        "God's Judgment on a Wicked Bishop": "The summer and autumn had been so wet,That in winter the corn was growing yet,'Twas a piteous sight to see all aroundThe grain lie rotting on the ground.Every day the starving poorCrowded around Bishop Hatto's door,For he had a plentiful last-year's store,And all the neighbourhood could tellHis granaries were furnish'd well.At last Bishop Hatto appointed a dayTo quiet the poor without delay;He bade them to his great Barn repair,And they should have food for the winter there.Rejoiced such tidings good to hear,The poor folk flock'd from far and near;The great barn was full as it could holdOf women and children, and young and old.Then when he saw it could hold no more,Bishop Hatto he made fast the door;And while for mercy on Christ they call,He set fire to the Barn and burnt them all.\"I'faith 'tis an excellent bonfire!\" quoth he,\"And the country is greatly obliged to me,For ridding it in these times forlornOf Rats that only consume the corn.\"So then to his palace returned he,And he sat down to supper merrily,And he slept that night like an innocent man;But Bishop Hatto never slept again.In the morning as he enter'd the hallWhere his picture hung against the wall,A sweat like death all over him came,For the Rats had eaten it out of the frame.As he look'd there came a man from his farm--He had a countenance white with alarm;\"My Lord, I open'd your granaries this morn,And the Rats had eaten all your corn.\"Another came running presently,And he was pale as pale could be,\"Fly! my Lord Bishop, fly,\" quoth he,\"Ten thousand Rats are coming this way,...The Lord forgive you for yesterday!\"\"I'll go to my tower on the Rhine,\" replied he,\"'Tis the safest place in Germany;The walls are high and the shores are steep,And the stream is strong and the water deep.\"Bishop Hatto fearfully hasten'd away,And he crost the Rhine without delay,And reach'd his tower, and barr'd with careAll the windows, doors, and loop-holes there.He laid him down and closed his eyes;...But soon a scream made him arise,He started and saw two eyes of flameOn his pillow from whence the screaming came.He listen'd and look'd;... it was only the Cat;And the Bishop he grew more fearful for that,For she sat screaming, mad with fearAt the Army of Rats that were drawing near.For they have swum over the river so deep,And they have climb'd the shores so steep,And up the Tower their way is bent,To do the work for which they were sent.They are not to be told by the dozen or score,By thousands they come, and by myriads and more,Such numbers had never been heard of before,Such a judgment had never been witness'd of yore.Down on his knees the Bishop fell,And faster and faster his beads did he tell,As louder and louder drawing nearThe gnawing of their teeth he could hear.And in at the windows and in at the door,And through the walls helter-skelter they pour,And down from the ceiling and up through the floor,From the right and the left, from behind and before,From within and without, from above and below,And all at once to the Bishop they go.They have whetted their teeth against the stones,And now they pick the Bishop's bones:They gnaw'd the flesh from every limb,For they were sent to do judgment on him!",

Anon, at the word,  There first came one daughter,  And then came another,  To second and third  The request of their brother,  And to hear how the water  Comes down at Lodore,  With its rush and its roar,  As many a time  They had seen it before.  So I told them in rhyme,  For of rhymes I had store;  And 'twas in my vocation  For their recreation  That so I should sing;  Because I was Laureate  To them and the King.    From its sources which well  In the tarn on the fell;  From its fountains  In the mountains,  Its rills and its gills;  Through moss and through brake,  It runs and it creeps  For a while, till it sleeps  In its own little lake.  And thence at departing,  Awakening and starting,  It runs through the reeds,  And away it proceeds,  Through meadow and glade,  In sun and in shade,  And through the wood-shelter,  Among crags in its flurry,  Helter-skelter,  Hurry-skurry.  Here it comes sparkling,  And there it lies darkling;  Now smoking and frothing  Its tumult and wrath in,  Till, in this rapid race  On which it is bent,  It reaches the place  Of its steep descent.    The cataract strong  Then plunges along,  Striking and raging    As if a war raging  Its caverns and rocks among;  Rising and leaping,  Sinking and creeping,  Swelling and sweeping,  Showering and springing,  Flying and flinging,  Writhing and ringing,  Eddying and whisking,  Spouting and frisking,  Turning and twisting,  Around and around  With endless rebound:  Smiting and fighting,  A sight to delight in;  Confounding, astounding,  Dizzying and deafening the ear with its sound.    Collecting, projecting,  Receding and speeding,  And shocking and rocking,  And darting and parting,  And threading and spreading,  And whizzing and hissing,  And dripping and skipping,  And hitting and splitting,  And shining and twining,  And rattling and battling,  And shaking and quaking,  And pouring and roaring,  And waving and raving,  And tossing and crossing,  And flowing and going,  And running and stunning,  And foaming and roaming,  And dinning and spinning,  And dropping and hopping,  And working and jerking,  And guggling and struggling,  And heaving and cleaving,  And moaning and groaning;    And glittering and frittering,  And gathering and feathering,  And whitening and brightening,  And quivering and shivering,  And hurrying and skurrying,  And thundering and floundering;    Dividing and gliding and sliding,  And falling and brawling and sprawling,  And driving and riving and striving,  And sprinkling and twinkling and wrinkling,  And sounding and bounding and rounding,  And bubbling and troubling and doubling,  And grumbling and rumbling and tumbling,  And clattering and battering and shattering;    Retreating and beating and meeting and sheeting,  Delaying and straying and playing and spraying,  Advancing and prancing and glancing and dancing,  Recoiling, turmoiling and toiling and boiling,  And gleaming and streaming and steaming and beaming,  And rushing and flushing and brushing and gushing,  And flapping and rapping and clapping and slapping,  And curling and whirling and purling and twirling,  And thumping and plumping and bumping and jumping,  And dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing;  And so never ending, but always descending,  Sounds and motions for ever and ever are blending  All at once and all o'er, with a mighty uproar, -  And this way the water comes down at Lodore."

        "The City of Dreadful Night": "As I came through the desert thus it was,As I came through the desert: All was black,In heaven no single star, on earth no track;A brooding hush without a stir or note,The air so thick it clotted in my throat;And thus for hours; then some enormous thingsSwooped past with savage cries and clanking wings:      But I strode on austere;      No hope could have no fear.As I came through the desert thus it was,As I came through the desert: Eyes of fireGlared at me throbbing with a starved desire;The hoarse and heavy and carnivorous breathWas hot upon me from deep jaws of death;Sharp claws, swift talons, fleshless fingers coldPlucked at me from the bushes, tried to hold:      But I strode on austere;      No hope could have no fear.As I came through the desert thus it was,As I came through the desert: Lo you, there,That hillock burning with a brazen glare;Those myriad dusky flames with points a-glowWhich writhed and hissed and darted to and fro;A Sabbath of the Serpents, heaped pell-mellFor Devil's roll-call and some fete of Hell:      Yet I strode on austere;      No hope could have no fear.As I came through the desert thus it was,As I came through the desert: Meteors ranAnd crossed their javelins on the black sky-span;The zenith opened to a gulf of flame,The dreadful thunderbolts jarred earth's fixed frame:The ground all heaved in waves of fire that surgedAnd weltered round me sole there unsubmerged:      Yet I strode on austere;      No hope could have no fear.As I came through the desert thus it was,As I came through the desert: Air once more,And I was close upon a wild sea-shore;Enormous cliffs arose on either hand,The deep tide thundered up a league-broad strand;White foambelts seethed there, wan spray swept and flew;The sky broke, moon and stars and clouds and blue:      And I strode on austere;      No hope could have no fear.As I came through the desert thus it was,As I came through the desert: On the leftThe sun arose and crowned a broad crag-cleft;There stopped and burned out black, except a rim,A bleeding eyeless socket, red and dim;Whereon the moon fell suddenly south-west,And stood above the right-hand cliffs at rest:      Still I strode on austere;      No hope could have no fear.As I came through the desert thus it was,As I came through the desert: From the rightA shape came slowly with a ruddy light;A woman with a red lamp in her hand,Bareheaded and barefooted on that strand;O desolation moving with such grace!O anguish with such beauty in thy face.      I fell as on my bier,      Hope travailed with such fear.As I came through the desert thus it was,As I came through the desert: I was twain,Two selves distinct that cannot join again;One stood apart and knew but could not stir,And watched the other stark in swoon and her;And she came on, and never turned aside,Between such sun and moon and roaring tide:      And as she came more near      My soul grew mad with fear.As I came through the desert thus it was,As I came through the desert: Hell is mildAnd piteous matched with that accursed wild;A large black sign was on her breast that bowed,A broad black band ran down her snow-white shroud;That lamp she held was her own burning heart,Whose blood-drops trickled step by step apart;      The mystery was clear;      Mad rage had swallowed fear.As I came through the desert thus it was,As I came through the desert: By the seaShe knelt and bent above that senseless me;Those lamp-drops fell upon my white brow there,She tried to cleanse them with her tears and hair;She murmured words of pity, love, and woe,She heeded not the level rushing flow:      And mad with rage and fear,      I stood stonebound so near.As I came through the desert thus it was,As I came through the desert: When the tideSwept up to her there kneeling by my side,She clasped that corpse-like me, and they were borneAway, and this vile me was left forlorn;I know the whole sea cannot quench that heart,Or cleanse that brow, or wash those two apart:      They love; their doom is drear,      Yet they nor hope nor fear;But I, what do I here?",
        "The Wine of Love": "The wine of Love is music,    And the feast of Love is song: And when Love sits down to the banquet,    Love sits long:  Sits long and ariseth drunken,    But not with the feast and the wine; He reeleth with his own heart,    That great rich Vine."

    "Robert Browning": {
        "The Pied Piper of Hamelin": "Hamelin Town's in Brunswick,    By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied;    But, when begins my ditty, Almost five hundred years ago, To see the townsfolk suffer so    From vermin, was a pity.        Rats! They fought the dogs, and killed the cats,    And bit the babies in the cradles, And eat the cheeses out of the vats,    And licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats       By drowning their speaking       With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats.  At last the people in a body    To the Town Hall came flocking: 'Tis clear, cried they, our Mayor's a noddy;    And as for our Corporation -- shocking To think we buy gowns lined with ermine For dolts that can't or won't determine What's like to rid us of our vermin! Rouse up, Sirs! Give your brains a racking To find the remedy we're lacking, Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!    At this the Mayor and Corporation    Quaked with a mighty consternation.  An hour they sate in council,    At length the Mayor broke silence: For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell;    I wish I were a mile hence! It's easy to bid one rack one's brain -- I'm sure my poor head aches again I've scratched it so, and all in vain. Oh for a trap, a trap, a trap! Just as he said this, what should hap At the chamber door but a gentle tap? Bless us, cried the Mayor, what's that? (With the Corporation as he sate, Looking little though wondrous fat); Only a scraping of shoes on the mat? Anything like the sound of a rat Makes my heart go pit-a-pat!  Come in! -- the Mayor cried, looking bigger: And in did come the strangest figure! His queer long coat from heel to head Was half of yellow and half of red; And he himself was tall and thin, With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin, And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin, No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin, But lips where smiles went out and in -- There was no guessing his kith and kin! And nobody could enough admire The tall man and his quaint attire: Quoth one: It's as my great-grandsire, Starting up at the Trump of Doom's tone, Had walked this way from his painted tombstone!  He advanced to the council-table: And, Please your honours, said he, I'm able, By means of a secret charm, to draw All creatures living beneath the sun, That creep, or swim, or fly, or run, After me so as you never saw! And I chiefly use my charm On creatures that do people harm, The mole, and toad, and newt, and viper; And people call me the Pied Piper. (And here they noticed round his neck A scarf of red and yellow stripe, To match with his coat of the self-same cheque; And at the scarf's end hung a pipe; And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying As if impatient to be playing Upon this pipe, as low it dangled Over his vesture so old-fangled.) Yet, said he, poor piper as I am, In Tartary I freed the Cham, Last June, from his huge swarms of gnats; I eased in Asia the Nizam Of a monstrous brood of vampyre-bats: And, as for what your brain bewilders, If I can rid your town of rats Will you give me a thousand guilders? One? fifty thousand! -- was the exclamation Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.  Into the street the Piper stept,    Smiling first a little smile, As if he knew what magic slept    In his quiet pipe the while; Then, like a musical adept, To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled, And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled, Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled; And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered, You heard as if an army muttered; And the muttering grew to a grumbling; And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling; And out of the houses the rats came tumbling. Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats, Brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats, Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,    Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,    Families by tens and dozens, Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives -- Followed the Piper for their lives. From street to street he piped advancing, And step for step they followed dancing, Until they came to the river Weser Wherein all plunged and perished  -- Save one who, stout as Julius Caesar, Swam across and lived to carry (As he the manuscript he cherished) To Rat-land home his commentary, Which was, At the first shrill notes of the pipe, I heard a sound as of scraping tripe, And putting apples, wondrous ripe, Into a cider-press's gripe: And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards, And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards, And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks, And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks; And it seemed as if a voice (Sweeter than by harp or by psaltery Is breathed) called out, Oh rats, rejoice! The world is grown to one vast drysaltery! 'So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon, 'Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon! And just as one bulky sugar-puncheon, Ready staved, like a great sun shone Glorious scarce an inch before me, Just as methought it said, Come, bore me!  -- I found the Weser rolling o'er me.  You should have heard the Hamelin people Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple; Go, cried the Mayor, and get long poles! Poke out the nests and block up the holes! Consult with carpenters and builders, And leave in our town not even a trace Of the rats! -- when suddenly up the face Of the Piper perked in the market-place, With a, First, if you please, my thousand guilders!  A thousand guilders! The Mayor looked blue; So did the Corporation too. For council dinners made rare havock With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock; And half the money would replenish Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish. To pay this sum to a wandering fellow With a gipsy coat of red and yellow! Beside, quoth the Mayor with a knowing wink, Our business was done at the river's brink; We saw with our eyes the vermin sink, And what's dead can't come to life, I think. So, friend, we're not the folks to shrink From the duty of giving you something for drink, And a matter of money to put in your poke; But, as for the guilders, what we spoke Of them, as you very well know, was in joke. Beside, our losses have made us thrifty; A thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!  The Piper's face fell, and he cried, No trifling! I can't wait, beside! I've promised to visit by dinner time Bagdat, and accept the prime Of the Head Cook's pottage, all he's rich in, For having left, in the Caliph's kitchen, Of a nest of scorpions no survivor -- With him I proved no bargain-driver, With you, don't think I'll bate a stiver! And folks who put me in a passion May find me pipe after another fashion.  How? cried the Mayor, d'ye think I'll brook Being worse treated than a Cook? Insulted by a lazy ribald With idle pipe and vesture piebald? You threaten us, fellow? Do your worst, Blow your pipe there till you burst!  Once more he stept into the street;    And to his lips again Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane;    And ere he blew three notes (such sweet Soft notes as yet musician's cunning    Never gave th'enraptured air) There was a rustling, that seem'd like a bustling Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling, Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering, Little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering, And, like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering, Out came the children running. All the little boys and girls, With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls, And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls, Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.  The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood As if they were changed into blocks of wood, Unable to move a step, or cry To the children merrily skipping by -- Could only follow with the eye That joyous crowd at the Piper's back. But how the Mayor was on the rack, And the wretched Council's bosoms beat, As the Piper turned from the High Street To where the Weser rolled its waters Right in the way of their sons and daughters! However he turned from South to West, And to Coppelburg Hill his steps addressed, And after him the children pressed; Great was the joy in every breast. He never can cross that mighty top! He's forced to let the piping drop, And we shall see our children stop! When, lo, as they reached the mountain's side, A wondrous portal opened wide, As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed; And the Piper advanced and the children follow'd, And when all were in to the very last, The door in the mountain side shut fast. Did I say, all? No! One was lame, And could not dance the whole of the way; And in after years, if you would blame His sadness, he was used to say, -- It's dull in our town since my playmates left! I can't forget that I'm bereft Of all the pleasant sights they see, Which the Piper also promised me; For he led us, he said, to a joyous land, Joining the town and just at hand, Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew, And flowers put forth a fairer hue, And every thing was strange and new; The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here, And their dogs outran our fallow deer, And honey-bees had lost their stings, And horses were born with eagles' wings: And just as I felt assured My lame foot would be speedily cured, The music stopped and I stood still, And found myself outside the Hill, Left alone against my will, To go now limping as before, And never hear of that country more!  Alas, alas for Hamelin!    There came into many a burgher's pate    A text which says, that Heaven's Gate    Opes to the Rich at as easy a rate As the needle's eye takes a camel in! The Mayor sent East, West, North, and South, To offer the Piper, by word of mouth,    Wherever it was men's lot to find him, Silver and gold to his heart's content, If he'd only return the way he went,    And bring the children behind him. But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavour, And Piper and dancers were gone for ever, They made a decree that lawyers never    Should think their records dated duly If, after the day of the month and year, These words did not as well appear, \"And so long after what happened here    \"On the Twenty-second of July, \"Thirteen hundred and Seventy-six:\" And the better in memory to fix The place of the Children's last retreat, They called it, The Pied Piper's Street -- Where any one playing on pipe or tabor Was sure for the future to lose his labour. Nor suffered they Hostelry or Tavern    To shock with mirth a street so solemn; But opposite the place of the cavern    They wrote the story on a column, And on the Great Church Window painted The same, to make the world acquainted How their children were stolen away; And there it stands to this very day. And I must not omit to say That in Transylvania there's a tribe Of alien people who ascribe The outlandish ways and dress On which their neighbours lay such stress To their fathers and mothers having risen Out of some subterraneous prison Into which they were trepanned Long time ago in a mighty band Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land, But how or why, they don't understand.  So, Willy, let you and me be wipers Of scores out with all men -- especially pipers: And, whether they pipe us from rats or from mice, If we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise.",

For think, had I painted the whole,\n    Why, there it had stood, to see, nor the process so wonder-worth:\nHad I written the same, made verse--still, effect proceeds from cause,\n    Ye know why the forms are fair, ye hear how the tale is told;\nIt is all triumphant art, but art in obedience to laws,\n    Painter and poet are proud in the artist-list enrolled:--\n\n  But here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can,\n    Existent behind all laws, that made them and, lo, they are!\nAnd I know not if, save in this, such gift be allowed to man,\n    That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star.\nConsider it well: each tone of our scale in itself is nought;\n    It is everywhere in the world--loud, soft, and all is said:\nGive it to me to use! I mix it with two in my thought:\n    And, there! Ye have heard and seen: consider and bow the head!\n\n  Well, it is gone at last, the palace of music I reared;\n    Gone! and the good tears start, the praises that come too slow;\nFor one is assured at first, one scarce can say that he feared,\n    That he even gave it a thought, the gone thing was to go.\nNever to be again! But many more of the kind\n    As good, nay, better, perchance: is this your comfort to me?\nTo me, who must be saved because I cling with my mind\n    To the same, same self, same love, same God: ay, what was, shall be.\n\n  Therefore to whom turn I but to thee, the ineffable Name?\n    Builder and maker, thou, of houses not made with hands!\nWhat, have fear of change from thee who art ever the same?\n    Doubt that thy power can fill the heart that thy power expands?\nThere shall never be one lost good! What was, shall live as before;\n    The evil is null, is nought, is silence implying sound;\nWhat was good shall be good, with, for evil, so much good more;\n    On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven, a perfect round.\n\n  All we have willed or hoped or dreamed of good shall exist;\n    Not its semblance, but itself; no beauty, nor good, nor power\nWhose voice has gone forth, but each survives for the melodist\n    When eternity affirms the conception of an hour.\nThe high that proved too high, the heroic for earth too hard,\n    The passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky,\nAre music sent up to God by the lover and the bard;\n    Enough that he heard it once: we shall hear it by and by.\n\n  And what is our failure here but a triumph's evidence\n    For the fulness of the days? Have we withered or agonized?\nWhy else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue thence?\n    Why rushed the discords in, but that harmony should be prized?\nSorrow is hard to bear, and doubt is slow to clear,\n    Each sufferer says his say, his scheme of the weal and woe:\nBut God has a few of us whom he whispers in the ear;\n    The rest may reason and welcome; 'tis we musicians know.\n\n  Well, it is earth with me; silence resumes her reign:\n    I will be patient and proud, and soberly acquiesce.\nGive me the keys. I feel for the common chord again,\n    Sliding by semitones till I sink to the minor,--yes,\nAnd I blunt it into a ninth, and I stand on alien ground,\n    Surveying awhile the heights I rolled from into the deep;\nWhich, hark, I have dared and done, for my resting-place is found,\n    The C Major of this life: so, now I will try to sleep.",
        "Among the Rocks": "Oh, good gigantic smile o' the brown old earth,\n    This autumn morning! How he sets his bones\nTo bask i' the sun, and thrusts out knees and feet\nFor the ripple to run over in its mirth;\n    Listening the while, where on the heap of stones\nThe white breast of the sea-lark twitters sweet.\n\nThat is the doctrine, simple, ancient, true;\n    Such is life's trial, as old earth smiles and knows.\nIf you loved only what were worth your love,\nLove were clear gain, and wholly well for you:\n    Make the low nature better by your throes!\nGive earth yourself, go up for gain above!",
        "Andrea del Sarto": "But do not let us quarrel any more, No, my Lucrezia; bear with me for once: Sit down and all shall happen as you wish. You turn your face, but does it bring your heart? I'll work then for your friend's friend, never fear, Treat his own subject after his own way, Fix his own time, accept too his own price, And shut the money into this small hand When next it takes mine. Will it? tenderly? Oh, I'll content him,--but to-morrow, Love! I often am much wearier than you think, This evening more than usual, and it seems As if--forgive now--should you let me sit Here by the window with your hand in mine And look a half-hour forth on Fiesole, Both of one mind, as married people use, Quietly, quietly the evening through, I might get up to-morrow to my work Cheerful and fresh as ever. Let us try. To-morrow, how you shall be glad for this! Your soft hand is a woman of itself, And mine the man's bared breast she curls inside. Don't count the time lost, neither; you must serve For each of the five pictures we require: It saves a model. So! keep looking so-- My serpentining beauty, rounds on rounds! --How could you ever prick those perfect ears, Even to put the pearl there! oh, so sweet-- My face, my moon, my everybody's moon, Which everybody looks on and calls his, And, I suppose, is looked on by in turn, While she looks--no one's: very dear, no less. You smile? why, there's my picture ready made, There's what we painters call our harmony! A common greyness silvers everything,-- All in a twilight, you and I alike --You, at the point of your first pride in me (That's gone you know),--but I, at every point; My youth, my hope, my art, being all toned down To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole. There's the bell clinking from the chapel-top; That length of convent-wall across the way Holds the trees safer, huddled more inside; The last monk leaves the garden; days decrease, And autumn grows, autumn in everything. Eh? the whole seems to fall into a shape As if I saw alike my work and self And all that I was born to be and do, A twilight-piece. Love, we are in God's hand. How strange now, looks the life he makes us lead; So free we seem, so fettered fast we are! I feel he laid the fetter: let it lie! This chamber for example--turn your head-- All that's behind us! You don't understand Nor care to understand about my art, But you can hear at least when people speak: And that cartoon, the second from the door --It is the thing, Love! so such things should be-- Behold Madonna!--I am bold to say.    I can do with my pencil what I know, What I see, what at bottom of my heart I wish for, if I ever wish so deep-- Do easily, too--when I say, perfectly, I do not boast, perhaps: yourself are judge, Who listened to the Legate's talk last week, And just as much they used to say in France. At any rate 'tis easy, all of it! No sketches first, no studies, that's long past: I do what many dream of, all their lives, --Dream? strive to do, and agonize to do, And fail in doing. I could count twenty such On twice your fingers, and not leave this town, Who strive--you don't know how the others strive To paint a little thing like that you smeared Carelessly passing with your robes afloat,-- Yet do much less, so much less, Someone says, (I know his name, no matter)--so much less! Well, less is more, Lucrezia: I am judged. There burns a truer light of God in them, In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain, Heart, or whate'er else, than goes on to prompt This low-pulsed forthright craftsman's hand of mine. Their works drop groundward, but themselves, I know, Reach many a time a heaven that's shut to me, Enter and take their place there sure enough, Though they come back and cannot tell the world. My works are nearer heaven, but I sit here. The sudden blood of these men! at a word-- Praise them, it boils, or blame them, it boils too. I, painting from myself and to myself, Know what I do, am unmoved by men's blame Or their praise either. Somebody remarks Morello's outline there is wrongly traced, His hue mistaken; what of that? or else, Rightly traced and well ordered; what of that? Speak as they please, what does the mountain care? Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, Or what's a heaven for? All is silver-grey, Placid and perfect with my art: the worse! I know both what I want and what might gain, And yet how profitless to know, to sigh \"Had I been two, another and myself, \"Our head would have o'erlooked the world!\" No doubt. Yonder's a work now, of that famous youth The Urbinate who died five years ago. ('Tis copied, George Vasari sent it me.) Well, I can fancy how he did it all, Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see, Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him, Above and through his art--for it gives way; That arm is wrongly put--and there again-- A fault to pardon in the drawing's lines, Its body, so to speak: its soul is right, He means right--that, a child may understand. Still, what an arm! and I could alter it: But all the play, the insight and the stretch-- (Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out? Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul, We might have risen to Rafael, I and you! Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think-- More than I merit, yes, by many times. But had you--oh, with the same perfect brow, And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth, And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare -- Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind! Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged \"God and the glory! never care for gain. \"The present by the future, what is that? \"Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo! \"Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!\" I might have done it for you. So it seems: Perhaps not. All is as God over-rules. Beside, incentives come from the soul's self; The rest avail not. Why do I need you? What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo? In this world, who can do a thing, will not; And who would do it, cannot, I perceive: Yet the will's somewhat--somewhat, too, the power-- And thus we half-men struggle. At the end, God, I conclude, compensates, punishes. 'Tis safer for me, if the award be strict, That I am something underrated here, Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth. I dared not, do you know, leave home all day, For fear of chancing on the Paris lords. The best is when they pass and look aside; But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all. Well may they speak! That Francis, that first time, And that long festal year at Fontainebleau! I surely then could sometimes leave the ground, Put on the glory, Rafael's daily wear, In that humane great monarch's golden look,-- One finger in his beard or twisted curl Over his mouth's good mark that made the smile, One arm about my shoulder, round my neck, The jingle of his gold chain in my ear, I painting proudly with his breath on me, All his court round him, seeing with his eyes, Such frank French eyes, and such a fire of souls Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts,-- And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond, This in the background, waiting on my work, To crown the issue with a last reward! A good time, was it not, my kingly days? And had you not grown restless... but I know-- 'Tis done and past: 'twas right, my instinct said: Too live the life grew, golden and not grey, And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt Out of the grange whose four walls make his world. How could it end in any other way? You called me, and I came home to your heart. The triumph was--to reach and stay there; since I reached it ere the triumph, what is lost? Let my hands frame your face in your hair's gold, You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine! \"Rafael did this, Andrea painted that; \"The Roman's is the better when you pray, \"But still the other's Virgin was his wife--\" Men will excuse me. I am glad to judge Both pictures in your presence; clearer grows My better fortune, I resolve to think. For, do you know, Lucrezia, as God lives, Said one day Agnolo, his very self, To Rafael . . . I have known it all these years . . . (When the young man was flaming out his thoughts Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see, Too lifted up in heart because of it) \"Friend, there's a certain sorry little scrub \"Goes up and down our Florence, none cares how, \"Who, were he set to plan and execute \"As you are, pricked on by your popes and kings, \"Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!\" To Rafael's!--And indeed the arm is wrong. I hardly dare . . . yet, only you to see, Give the chalk here--quick, thus, the line should go! Ay, but the soul! he's Rafael! rub it out! Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth, (What he? why, who but Michel Agnolo? Do you forget already words like those?) If really there was such a chance, so lost,-- Is, whether you're--not grateful--but more pleased. Well, let me think so. And you smile indeed! This hour has been an hour! Another smile? If you would sit thus by me every night I should work better, do you comprehend? I mean that I should earn more, give you more. See, it is settled dusk now; there's a star; Morello's gone, the watch-lights show the wall, The cue-owls speak the name we call them by. Come from the window, love,--come in, at last, Inside the melancholy little house We built to be so gay with. God is just. King Francis may forgive me: oft at nights When I look up from painting, eyes tired out, The walls become illumined, brick from brick Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce bright gold, That gold of his I did cement them with! Let us but love each other. Must you go? That Cousin here again? he waits outside? Must see you--you, and not with me? Those loans? More gaming debts to pay? you smiled for that? Well, let smiles buy me! have you more to spend? While hand and eye and something of a heart Are left me, work's my ware, and what's it worth? I'll pay my fancy. Only let me sit The grey remainder of the evening out, Idle, you call it, and muse perfectly How I could paint, were I but back in France, One picture, just one more--the Virgin's face, Not yours this time! I want you at my side To hear them--that is, Michel Agnolo-- Judge all I do and tell you of its worth. Will you? To-morrow, satisfy your friend. I take the subjects for his corridor, Finish the portrait out of hand--there, there, And throw him in another thing or two If he demurs; the whole should prove enough To pay for this same Cousin's freak. Beside, What's better and what's all I care about, Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff! Love, does that please you? Ah, but what does he, The Cousin! what does he to please you more?  I am grown peaceful as old age to-night. I regret little, I would change still less. Since there my past life lies, why alter it? The very wrong to Francis!--it is true I took his coin, was tempted and complied, And built this house and sinned, and all is said. My father and my mother died of want. Well, had I riches of my own? you see How one gets rich! Let each one bear his lot. They were born poor, lived poor, and poor they died: And I have laboured somewhat in my time And not been paid profusely. Some good son Paint my two hundred pictures--let him try! No doubt, there's something strikes a balance. Yes, You loved me quite enough. it seems to-night. This must suffice me here. What would one have? In heaven, perhaps, new chances, one more chance-- Four great walls in the New Jerusalem, Meted on each side by the angel's reed, For Leonard, Rafael, Agnolo and me To cover--the three first without a wife, While I have mine! So--still they overcome Because there's still Lucrezia,--as I choose.  Again the Cousin's whistle! Go, my Love.",
        "The Bishop Orders His Tomb at Saint Praxed's Church": "Rome, 15--\n\n\n\nVanity, saith the preacher, vanity! Draw round my bed: is Anselm keeping back? Nephews--sons mine . . . ah God, I know not! Well-- She, men would have to be your mother once, Old Gandolf envied me, so fair she was! What's done is done, and she is dead beside, Dead long ago, and I am Bishop since, And as she died so must we die ourselves, And thence ye may perceive the world's a dream. Life, how and what is it? As here I lie In this state-chamber, dying by degrees, Hours and long hours in the dead night, I ask \"Do I live, am I dead?\" Peace, peace seems all. Saint Praxed's ever was the church for peace; And so, about this tomb of mine. I fought With tooth and nail to save my niche, ye know: --Old Gandolf cozened me, despite my care; Shrewd was that snatch from out the corner South He graced his carrion with, God curse the same! Yet still my niche is not so cramped but thence One sees the pulpit o' the epistle-side, And somewhat of the choir, those silent seats, And up into the aery dome where live The angels, and a sunbeam's sure to lurk: And I shall fill my slab of basalt there, And 'neath my tabernacle take my rest, With those nine columns round me, two and two, The odd one at my feet where Anselm stands: Peach-blossom marble all, the rare, the ripe As fresh-poured red wine of a mighty pulse. --Old Gandolf with his paltry onion-stone, Put me where I may look at him! True peach, Rosy and flawless: how I earned the prize! Draw close: that conflagration of my church --What then? So much was saved if aught were missed! My sons, ye would not be my death? Go dig The white-grape vineyard where the oil-press stood, Drop water gently till the surface sink, And if ye find . . . Ah God, I know not, I! ... Bedded in store of rotten fig-leaves soft, And corded up in a tight olive-frail, Some lump, ah God, of lapis lazuli, Big as a Jew's head cut off at the nape, Blue as a vein o'er the Madonna's breast ... Sons, all have I bequeathed you, villas, all, That brave Frascati villa with its bath, So, let the blue lump poise between my knees, Like God the Father's globe on both His hands Ye worship in the Jesu Church so gay, For Gandolf shall not choose but see and burst! Swift as a weaver's shuttle fleet our years: Man goeth to the grave, and where is he? Did I say basalt for my slab, sons? Black-- 'Twas ever antique-black I meant! How else Shall ye contrast my frieze to come beneath? The bas-relief in bronze ye promised me, Those Pans and Nymphs ye wot of, and perchance Some tripod, thyrsus, with a vase or so, The Saviour at his sermon on the mount, Saint Praxed in a glory, and one Pan Ready to twitch the Nymph's last garment off, And Moses with the tables . . . but I know Ye mark me not! What do they whisper thee, Child of my bowels, Anselm? Ah, ye hope To revel down my villas while I gasp Bricked o'er with beggar's mouldy travertine Which Gandolf from his tomb-top chuckles at! Nay, boys, ye love me--all of jasper, then! 'Tis jasper ye stand pledged to, lest I grieve. My bath must needs be left behind, alas! One block, pure green as a pistachio-nut, There's plenty jasper somewhere in the world-- And have I not Saint Praxed's ear to pray Horses for ye, and brown Greek manuscripts, And mistresses with great smooth marbly limbs? --That's if ye carve my epitaph aright, Choice Latin, picked phrase, Tully's every word, No gaudy ware like Gandolf's second line-- Tully, my masters? Ulpian serves his need! And then how I shall lie through centuries, And hear the blessed mutter of the mass, And see God made and eaten all day long, And feel the steady candle-flame, and taste Good strong thick stupefying incense-smoke! For as I lie here, hours of the dead night, Dying in state and by such slow degrees, I fold my arms as if they clasped a crook, And stretch my feet forth straight as stone can point, And let the bedclothes, for a mortcloth, drop Into great laps and folds of sculptor's-work: And as yon tapers dwindle, and strange thoughts Grow, with a certain humming in my ears, About the life before I lived this life, And this life too, popes, cardinals and priests, Saint Praxed at his sermon on the mount, Your tall pale mother with her talking eyes, And new-found agate urns as fresh as day, And marble's language, Latin pure, discreet, --Aha, ELUCESCEBAT quoth our friend? No Tully, said I, Ulpian at the best! Evil and brief hath been my pilgrimage. All lapis, all, sons! Else I give the Pope My villas! Will ye ever eat my heart? Ever your eyes were as a lizard's quick, They glitter like your mother's for my soul, Or ye would heighten my impoverished frieze, Piece out its starved design, and fill my vase With grapes, and add a vizor and a Term, And to the tripod ye would tie a lynx That in his struggle throws the thyrsus down, To comfort me on my entablature Whereon I am to lie till I must ask \"Do I live, am I dead?\" There, leave me, there! For ye have stabbed me with ingratitude To death--ye wish it--God, ye wish it! Stone-- Gritstone, a-crumble! Clammy squares which sweat As if the corpse they keep were oozing through-- And no more lapis to delight the world! Well, go! I bless ye. Fewer tapers there, But in a row: and, going, turn your backs --Ay, like departing altar-ministrants, And leave me in my church, the church for peace, That I may watch at leisure if he leers-- Old Gandolf, at me, from his onion-stone, As still he envied me, so fair she was!",
        "Caliban upon Setebos": "\"Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself.\"\n(David, Psalms 50.21)\n\n\n\n\n['Will sprawl, now that the heat of day is best,\nFlat on his belly in the pit's much mire,\nWith elbows wide, fists clenched to prop his chin.\nAnd, while he kicks both feet in the cool slush,\nAnd feels about his spine small eft-things course,\nRun in and out each arm, and make him laugh:\nAnd while above his head a pompion-plant,\nCoating the cave-top as a brow its eye,\nCreeps down to touch and tickle hair and beard,\nAnd now a flower drops with a bee inside,\nAnd now a fruit to snap at, catch and crunch,--\nHe looks out o'er yon sea which sunbeams cross\nAnd recross till they weave a spider-web\n(Meshes of fire, some great fish breaks at times)\nAnd talks to his own self, howe'er he please,\nTouching that other, whom his dam called God.\nBecause to talk about Him, vexes--ha,\nCould He but know! and time to vex is now,\nWhen talk is safer than in winter-time.\nMoreover Prosper and Miranda sleep\nIn confidence he drudges at their task,\nAnd it is good to cheat the pair, and gibe,\nLetting the rank tongue blossom into speech.]\n\nSetebos, Setebos, and Setebos!\n'Thinketh, He dwelleth i' the cold o' the moon.\n\n'Thinketh He made it, with the sun to match,\nBut not the stars; the stars came otherwise;\nOnly made clouds, winds, meteors, such as that:\nAlso this isle, what lives and grows thereon,\nAnd snaky sea which rounds and ends the same.\n\n'Thinketh, it came of being ill at ease:\nHe hated that He cannot change His cold,\nNor cure its ache. 'Hath spied an icy fish\nThat longed to 'scape the rock-stream where she lived,\nAnd thaw herself within the lukewarm brine\nO' the lazy sea her stream thrusts far amid,\nA crystal spike 'twixt two warm walls of wave;\nOnly, she ever sickened, found repulse\nAt the other kind of water, not her life,\n(Green-dense and dim-delicious, bred o' the sun)\nFlounced back from bliss she was not born to breathe,\nAnd in her old bounds buried her despair,\nHating and loving warmth alike: so He.\n\n'Thinketh, He made thereat the sun, this isle,\nTrees and the fowls here, beast and creeping thing.\nYon otter, sleek-wet, black, lithe as a leech;\nYon auk, one fire-eye in a ball of foam,\nThat floats and feeds; a certain badger brown\nHe hath watched hunt with that slant white-wedge eye\nBy moonlight; and the pie with the long tongue\nThat pricks deep into oak warts for a worm,\nAnd says a plain word when she finds her prize,\nBut will not eat the ants; the ants themselves\nThat build a wall of seeds and settled stalks\nAbout their hole--He made all these and more,\nMade all we see, and us, in spite: how else?\nHe could not, Himself, make a second self\nTo be His mate; as well have made Himself:\nHe would not make what He mislikes or slights,\nAn eyesore to Him, or not worth His pains:\nBut did, in envy, listlessness or sport,\nMake what Himself would fain, in a manner, be--\nWeaker in most points, stronger in a few,\nWorthy, and yet mere playthings all the while,\nThings He admires and mocks too,--that is it.\nBecause, so brave, so better though they be,\nIt nothing skills if He begin to plague.\nLook, now, I melt a gourd-fruit into mash,\nAdd honeycomb and pods, I have perceived,\nWhich bite like finches when they bill and kiss,--\nThen, when froth rises bladdery, drink up all,\nQuick, quick, till maggots scamper through my brain;\nLast, throw me on my back i' the seeded thyme,\nAnd wanton, wishing I were born a bird.\nPut case, unable to be what I wish,\nI yet could make a live bird out of clay:\nWould not I take clay, pinch my Caliban\nAble to fly?--for, there, see, he hath wings,\nAnd great comb like the hoopoe's to admire,\nAnd there, a sting to do his foes offence,\nThere, and I will that he begin to live,\nFly to yon rock-top, nip me off the horns\nOf grigs high up that make the merry din,\nSaucy through their veined wings, and mind me not.\nIn which feat, if his leg snapped, brittle clay,\nAnd he lay stupid-like,--why, I should laugh;\nAnd if he, spying me, should fall to weep,\nBeseech me to be good, repair his wrong,\nBid his poor leg smart less or grow again,--\nWell, as the chance were, this might take or else\nNot take my fancy: I might hear his cry,\nAnd give the mankin three sound legs for one,\nOr pluck the other off, leave him like an egg\nAnd lessoned he was mine and merely clay.\nWere this no pleasure, lying in the thyme,\nDrinking the mash, with brain become alive,\nMaking and marring clay at will?

        "A Grammarian's Funeral": "Shortly after the Revival of Learning in Europe\n\n\n\nLet us begin and carry up this corpse,          Singing together. Leave we the common crofts, the vulgar thorpes          Each in its tether Sleeping safe on the bosom of the plain,          Cared-for till cock-crow: Look out if yonder be not day again          Rimming the rock-row! That's the appropriate country; there, man's thought,          Rarer, intenser, Self-gathered for an outbreak, as it ought,          Chafes in the censer. Leave we the unlettered plain its herd and crop;          Seek we sepulture On a tall mountain, citied to the top,          Crowded with culture! All the peaks soar, but one the rest excels;          Clouds overcome it; No! yonder sparkle is the citadel's          Circling its summit. Thither our path lies; wind we up the heights:          Wait ye the warning? Our low life was the level's and the night's;          He's for the morning. Step to a tune, square chests, erect each head,          'Ware the beholders! This is our master, famous, calm and dead,          Borne on our shoulders.     Sleep, crop and herd! sleep, darkling thorpe and croft,          Safe from the weather! He, whom we convoy to his grave aloft,          Singing together, He was a man born with thy face and throat,          Lyric Apollo! Long he lived nameless: how should spring take note          Winter would follow? Till lo, the little touch, and youth was gone!          Cramped and diminished, Moaned he, \"New measures, other feet anon!          My dance is finished\"? No, that's the world's way: (keep the mountain-side,          Make for the city!) He knew the signal, and stepped on with pride           Over men's pity; Left play for work, and grappled with the world           Bent on escaping: \"What's in the scroll,\" quoth he, \"thou keepest furled           Show me their shaping, Theirs who most studied man, the bard and sage,           Give!\" So, he gowned him, Straight got by heart that book to its last page:           Learned, we found him. Yea, but we found him bald too, eyes like lead,           Accents uncertain: \"Time to taste life,\" another would have said,           \"Up with the curtain!\" This man said rather, \"Actual life comes next?           Patience a moment! Grant I have mastered learning's crabbed text,           Still there's the comment. Let me know all! Prate not of most or least,           Painful or easy! Even to the crumbs I'd fain eat up the feast,           Ay, nor feel queasy.\" Oh, such a life as he resolved to live,           When he had learned it, When he had gathered all books had to give!           Sooner, he spurned it. Image the whole, then execute the parts           Fancy the fabric Quite, ere you build, ere steel strike fire from quartz,           Ere mortar dab brick!      (Here's the town-gate reached: there's the market-place           Gaping before us.) Yea, this in him was the peculiar grace           (Hearten our chorus!) That before living he'd learn how to live           No end to learning: Earn the means first   God surely will contrive           Use for our earning. Others mistrust and say, \"But time escapes:           Live now or never!\" He said, \"What's time? Leave Now for dogs and apes!           Man has Forever.\" Back to his book then: deeper drooped his head:           Calculus racked him: Leaden before, his eyes grew dross of lead:           Tussis attacked him. \"Now, master, take a little rest!\" not he!           (Caution redoubled Step two abreast, the way winds narrowly!)           Not a whit troubled, Back to his studies, fresher than at first,           Fierce as a dragon He (soul-hydroptic with a sacred thirst)           Sucked at the flagon. Oh, if we draw a circle premature,           Heedless of far gain, Greedy for quick returns of profit, sure           Bad is our bargain! Was it not great? did not he throw on God,           (He loves the burthen) God's task to make the heavenly period           Perfect the earthen? Did not he magnify the mind, show clear           Just what it all meant? He would not discount life, as fools do here,           Paid by instalment. He ventured neck or nothing heaven's success           Found, or earth's failure: \"Wilt thou trust death or not?\" He answered \"Yes:           Hence with life's pale lure!\" That low man seeks a little thing to do,           Sees it and does it: This high man, with a great thing to pursue,           Dies ere he knows it. That low man goes on adding one to one,           His hundred's soon hit: This high man, aiming at a million,           Misses an unit. That, has the world here   should he need the next,           Let the world mind him! This, throws himself on God, and unperplexed           Seeking shall find him. So, with the throttling hands of death at strife,           Ground he at grammar; Still, thro' the rattle, parts of speech were rife:           While he could stammer He settled Hoti's business let it be!           Properly based Oun Gave us the doctrine of the enclitic De,           Dead from the waist down. Well, here's the platform, here's the proper place:           Hail to your purlieus, All ye highfliers of the feathered race,           Swallows and curlews! Here's the top-peak; the multitude below           Live, for they can, there: This man decided not to Live but Know           Bury this man there? Here   here's his place, where meteors shoot, clouds form,           Lightnings are loosened, Stars come and go! Let joy break with the storm,           Peace let the dew send! Lofty designs must close in like effects:           Loftily lying, Leave him   still loftier than the world suspects,           Living and dying.",

        "The Laboratory": "Now that I, tying thy glass mask tightly, May gaze thro' these faint smokes curling whitely, As thou pliest thy trade in this devil's-smithy-- Which is the poison to poison her, prithee?     He is with her, and they know that I know Where they are, what they do: they believe my tears flow While they laugh, laugh at me, at me fled to the drear Empty church, to pray God in, for them!--I am here.     Grind away, moisten and mash up thy paste, Pound at thy powder,--I am not in haste! Better sit thus and observe thy strange things, Than go where men wait me and dance at the King's.     That in the mortar--you call it a gum? Ah, the brave tree whence such gold oozings come! And yonder soft phial, the exquisite blue, Sure to taste sweetly,--is that poison too?     Had I but all of them, thee and thy treasures, What a wild crowd of invisible pleasures! To carry pure death in an earring, a casket, A signet, a fan-mount, a filigree basket!     Soon, at the King's, a mere lozenge to give And Pauline should have just thirty minutes to live! But to light a pastile, and Elise, with her head And her breast and her arms and her hands, should drop dead!     Quick--is it finished? The colour's too grim! Why not soft like the phial's, enticing and dim? Let it brighten her drink, let her turn it and stir, And try it and taste, ere she fix and prefer!     What a drop! She's not little, no minion like me-- That's why she ensnared him: this never will free The soul from those masculine eyes,--say, \"no!\" To that pulse's magnificent come-and-go.     For only last night, as they whispered, I brought My own eyes to bear on her so, that I thought Could I keep them one half minute fixed, she would fall, Shrivelled; she fell not; yet this does it all!     Not that I bid you spare her the pain! Let death be felt and the proof remain; Brand, burn up, bite into its grace-- He is sure to remember her dying face!     Is it done? Take my mask off! Nay, be not morose; It kills her, and this prevents seeing it close: The delicate droplet, my whole fortune's fee-- If it hurts her, beside, can it ever hurt me?     Now, take all my jewels, gorge gold to your fill, You may kiss me, old man, on my mouth if you will! But brush this dust off me, lest horror it brings Ere I know it--next moment I dance at the King's!",
        "Life in a Love": "Escape me?\nNever--\nBeloved!\nWhile I am I, and you are you,\n      So long as the world contains us both,\n      Me the loving and you the loth,\nWhile the one eludes, must the other pursue.\nMy life is a fault at last, I fear:\nIt seems too much like a fate, indeed!\nThough I do my best I shall scarce succeed.\nBut what if I fail of my purpose here?\nIt is but to keep the nerves at strain,\nTo dry one's eyes and laugh at a fall,\nAnd, baffled, get up and begin again,--\nSo the chase takes up one's life, that's all.\nWhile, look but once from your farthest bound\nAt me so deep in the dust and dark,\nNo sooner the old hope goes to ground\nThan a new one, straight to the self-same mark,\nI shape me--\nEver\nRemoved!",
        "The Lost Leader": "Just for a handful of silver he left us,\n    Just for a riband to stick in his coat--\nFound the one gift of which fortune bereft us,\n    Lost all the others she lets us devote;\nThey, with the gold to give, doled him out silver,\n    So much was theirs who so little allowed:\nHow all our copper had gone for his service!\n    Rags--were they purple, his heart had been proud!\nWe that had loved him so, followed him, honoured him,\n    Lived in his mild and magnificent eye,\nLearned his great language, caught his clear accents,\n    Made him our pattern to live and to die!\nShakespeare was of us, Milton was for us,\n    Burns, Shelley, were with us,--they watch from their graves!\nHe alone breaks from the van and the freemen,\n    --He alone sinks to the rear and the slaves!\n\nWe shall march prospering,--not thro' his presence;\n    Songs may inspirit us,--not from his lyre;\nDeeds will be done,--while he boasts his quiescence,\n    Still bidding crouch whom the rest bade aspire:\nBlot out his name, then, record one lost soul more,\n    One task more declined, one more footpath untrod,\nOne more devils'-triumph and sorrow for angels,\n    One wrong more to man, one more insult to God!\nLife's night begins: let him never come back to us!\n    There would be doubt, hesitation and pain,\nForced praise on our part--the glimmer of twilight,\n    Never glad confident morning again!\nBest fight on well, for we taught him--strike gallantly,\n    Menace our heart ere we master his own;\nThen let him receive the new knowledge and wait us,\n    Pardoned in heaven, the first by the throne!",
        "Love among the Ruins": "Where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles,\n      Miles and miles\nOn the solitary pastures where our sheep\n      Half-asleep\nTinkle homeward thro' the twilight, stray or stop\n      As they crop--\nWas the site once of a city great and gay,\n      (So they say)\nOf our country's very capital, its prince\n      Ages since\nHeld his court in, gathered councils, wielding far\n      Peace or war.\n\nNow the country does not even boast a tree,\n      As you see,\nTo distinguish slopes of verdure, certain rills\n      From the hills\nIntersect and give a name to, (else they run\n      Into one)\nWhere the domed and daring palace shot its spires\n      Up like fires\nO'er the hundred-gated circuit of a wall\n      Bounding all\nMade of marble, men might march on nor be prest\n      Twelve abreast.\n\nAnd such plenty and perfection, see, of grass\n      Never was!\nSuch a carpet as, this summer-time, o'er-spreads\n      And embeds\nEvery vestige of the city, guessed alone,\n      Stock or stone--\nWhere a multitude of men breathed joy and woe\n      Long ago;\nLust of glory pricked their hearts up, dread of shame\n      Struck them tame;\nAnd that glory and that shame alike, the gold\n      Bought and sold.\n\nNow--the single little turret that remains\n      On the plains,\nBy the caper overrooted, by the gourd\n      Overscored,\nWhile the patching houseleek's head of blossom winks\n      Through the chinks--\nMarks the basement whence a tower in ancient time\n      Sprang sublime,\nAnd a burning ring, all round, the chariots traced\n      As they raced,\nAnd the monarch and his minions and his dames\n      Viewed the games.\n\nAnd I know, while thus the quiet-coloured eve\n      Smiles to leave\nTo their folding, all our many-tinkling fleece\n      In such peace,\nAnd the slopes and rills in undistinguished grey\n      Melt away--\nThat a girl with eager eyes and yellow hair\n      Waits me there\nIn the turret whence the charioteers caught soul\n      For the goal,\nWhen the king looked, where she looks now, breathless, dumb\n        Till I come.\n\nBut he looked upon the city, every side,\n      Far and wide,\nAll the mountains topped with temples, all the glades'\n      Colonnades,\nAll the causeys, bridges, aqueducts,--and then\n      All the men!\nWhen I do come, she will speak not, she will stand,\n      Either hand\nOn my shoulder, give her eyes the first embrace\n      Of my face,\nEre we rush, ere we extinguish sight and speech\n      Each on each.\n\nIn one year they sent a million fighters forth\n      South and North,\nAnd they built their gods a brazen pillar high\n      As the sky\nYet reserved a thousand chariots in full force--\n      Gold, of course.\nO heart! oh blood that freezes, blood that burns!\n      Earth's returns\nFor whole centuries of folly, noise and sin!\n      Shut them in,\nWith their triumphs and their glories and the rest!\n      Love is best.",
